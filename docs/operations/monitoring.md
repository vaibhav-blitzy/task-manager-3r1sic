Key configuration elements:
- **Global Settings**: Default scrape interval of 15s with 5s timeout
- **Job Definitions**: Service-specific scrape configurations
- **Service Discovery**: Dynamic target discovery via Kubernetes API
- **Alerting Rules**: Defined in `/etc/prometheus/rules/*.yml`
- **Recording Rules**: Pre-calculated metrics for dashboard efficiency

```yaml
# Example scrape configuration for a service
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'api-gateway'
    metrics_path: '/metrics'
    scheme: 'http'
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: pod
        namespaces:
          names:

  - Delete after 90 days

**Logstash Configuration**:
- Parse and transform logs from services
- Filter sensitive information
- Enrich logs with metadata
- Stream logs to Elasticsearch
- Main config: `/etc/logstash/conf.d/task-management.conf`

**Kibana Configuration**:
- Index patterns for application logs, system logs, and audit logs
- Saved searches for common queries
- Dashboards for log visualization and analysis

### OpenTelemetry Integration

OpenTelemetry provides distributed tracing across all services.

**Key Components**:
- Instrumentation libraries for Python services
- OpenTelemetry Collector for trace processing
- Jaeger for trace storage and visualization

**Configuration**:
- Sampling rate: 10% for normal traffic, 100% for errors
- Trace context propagation via HTTP headers
- Service boundaries defined for proper visualization

## Metrics Collection

### Infrastructure Metrics

| Metric Type | Examples | Collection Method | Alert Thresholds |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| CPU | System/user CPU usage, load average | node_exporter | >80% sustained |
| Memory | Used memory, swap usage | node_exporter | >85% used, any swap |
| Disk | Used space, IOPS, latency | node_exporter | >85% used, I/O latency >100ms |
| Network | Bytes in/out, errors, drops | node_exporter | Error rate >0.1% |
| Container | CPU/memory usage, restarts | cAdvisor | >90% of limits, >2 restarts/5min |

### Application Metrics

All services expose metrics via the `/metrics` endpoint, which is scraped by Prometheus.

**Standard Service Metrics**:
- `http_requests_total{method, path, status_code}`: Request count by endpoint and status
- `http_request_duration_seconds{method, path}`: Request latency histogram
- `http_request_size_bytes{method, path}`: Request size histogram
- `http_response_size_bytes{method, path}`: Response size histogram
- `app_instance_info{version, instance_id}`: Service version information

**Service-Specific Metrics**:

*Authentication Service*:
- `auth_login_attempts_total{status}`
- `auth_token_issues_total`
- `auth_active_sessions_gauge`

*Task Service*:
- `tasks_created_total`
- `tasks_completed_total`
- `tasks_overdue_gauge`
- `task_completion_time_seconds`

*Project Service*:
- `projects_created_total`
- `project_members_gauge`
- `project_task_count_gauge`

*Database Metrics*:
- `db_query_duration_seconds{operation, collection}`
- `db_connection_pool_size`
- `db_operation_total{operation, status}`

*Cache Metrics*:
- `cache_hits_total`
- `cache_misses_total`
- `cache_hit_ratio`
- `cache_size_bytes`

### SLA Metrics

The system tracks metrics for Service Level Agreement compliance:

| SLA Metric | Prometheus Query | Target |
|------------|------------------|--------|
| System Uptime | `1 - avg(rate(service_downtime_seconds_total[30d]))` | 99.9% |
| API Response Time | `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{service=~"api-.*"}[5m])) by (le))` | <500ms |
| Error Rate | `sum(rate(http_requests_total{status_code=~"5.."}[5m])) / sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))` | <0.1% |
| End-to-end Task Creation | `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(task_creation_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le))` | <2s |

### Custom Metrics Implementation

To add custom metrics to a service:

1. Use the Prometheus client library for your language:

```python
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, Gauge, Summary

# Define metrics
tasks_created = Counter('tasks_created_total', 'Total number of tasks created')
task_completion_time = Histogram('task_completion_time_seconds', 
                                 'Time taken to complete tasks',
                                 buckets=[60, 300, 900, 3600, 86400, 604800])

# Update metrics in code
tasks_created.inc()
task_completion_time.observe(duration)
```

2. Ensure metrics endpoint is exposed:

```python
from prometheus_client import make_wsgi_app
from werkzeug.middleware.dispatcher import DispatcherMiddleware

# Add metrics endpoint to Flask app
app.wsgi_app = DispatcherMiddleware(app.wsgi_app, {
    '/metrics': make_wsgi_app()
})
```

3. Update Prometheus configuration to scrape the new metrics.

4. Document the new metrics in the service's documentation.

## Logging Framework

The Task Management System implements structured logging across all services using a consistent JSON format for easy parsing and analysis.

### Log Levels and Usage

| Level | Purpose | Examples |
|-------|---------|----------|
| DEBUG | Detailed information for debugging | Function parameters, detailed execution steps |
| INFO | Normal operational events | Request received, task created, successful operations |
| WARNING | Potential issues that don't affect operation | Slow queries, retry attempts, deprecated API usage |
| ERROR | Errors that affect a single operation | Failed API calls, database errors, validation failures |
| CRITICAL | Severe errors affecting multiple operations | Service unavailable, database connection lost |

### Structured Log Format

All services use JSON-formatted logs with standardized fields:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-11-01T12:34:56.789Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service": "task-service",
  "instance": "task-service-5d4f89c77b-2xvz9",
  "trace_id": "7b5a3f6c9d0e1b2a3c4d5e6f",
  "correlation_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "user_id": "user_12345",
  "message": "Task created successfully",
  "details": {
    "task_id": "task_67890",
    "project_id": "project_12345",
    "duration_ms": 45
  }
}
```

### Log Sources

| Source | Log Types | Collection Method | Location |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| Application Services | Application logs | Fluent Bit agent | `/var/log/containers/` |
| API Gateway | Access logs, application logs | Fluent Bit agent | `/var/log/containers/` |
| Nginx | Access logs, error logs | Fluent Bit agent | `/var/log/nginx/` |
| MongoDB | Database logs | CloudWatch Logs agent | CloudWatch Logs |
| Redis | Cache logs | CloudWatch Logs agent | CloudWatch Logs |
| AWS Services | Cloud resource logs | CloudWatch Logs | CloudWatch Logs |

### Log Retention

| Log Type | Hot Storage (Elasticsearch) | Cold Storage (S3) |
|----------|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| Application Logs | 30 days | 1 year |
| Access Logs | 90 days | 2 years |
| Audit Logs | 90 days | 7 years |
| System Logs | 14 days | 180 days |

### Sensitive Data Handling

The logging system automatically redacts sensitive information:

1. PII detection and redaction is implemented in the logger module:

```python
# From src/backend/common/logging/logger.py
PII_PATTERNS = {
    "email": re.compile(r'[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}'),
    "credit_card": re.compile(r'\b(?:\d[ -]*?){13,16}\b'),
    "phone": re.compile(r'\b(?:\+\d{1,2}\s?)?\(?\d{3}\)?[\s.-]?\d{3}[\s.-]?\d{4}\b'),
    "ssn": re.compile(r'\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b')
}

def redact_pii(message: str) -> str:
    """
    Redacts personally identifiable information (PII) from log messages.
    """
    if message is None or not isinstance(message, str):
        return message
    
    # Iterate through all PII patterns and redact matches
    for pattern_name, pattern in PII_PATTERNS.items():
        message = pattern.sub(PII_REPLACEMENT, message)
    
    return message
```

2. Authentication tokens and passwords are never logged.
3. User IDs are logged for traceability but not associated personal information.

### Accessing Logs

**Kibana Access**:
- URL: https://kibana.internal.taskmanagement.com
- Authentication: SSO with role-based access
- Saved searches for common scenarios available in "Saved Objects"

**Common Queries**:

Find errors for a specific service:
```
service: "task-service" AND level: "ERROR"
```

Track a specific user's actions:
```
user_id: "user_12345" AND level: "INFO"
```

Follow a request across services:
```
correlation_id: "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890"
```

## Distributed Tracing

The system uses OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing to track requests as they flow through multiple services.

### Trace Collection Process

1. Incoming requests receive a unique trace ID if not already present
2. Services propagate trace context via HTTP headers
3. Services report spans to the OpenTelemetry Collector
4. The collector processes and sends traces to Jaeger
5. Jaeger stores and indexes traces for visualization

### Sampling Strategy

- Production environment: 10% of normal traffic, 100% of errors or high-latency requests
- Staging environment: 50% of all traffic
- Development environment: 100% of all traffic
- Custom endpoints (e.g., health checks): 1% sampling to reduce noise

### Instrumentation

Services are instrumented using OpenTelemetry SDKs:

```python
# Example instrumentation for Flask applications
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.flask import FlaskInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter

# Set up tracer provider
provider = TracerProvider()
processor = BatchSpanProcessor(OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint="otel-collector:4317"))
provider.add_span_processor(processor)
trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)

# Instrument Flask application
FlaskInstrumentor().instrument_app(app)

# Create custom spans
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)
with tracer.start_as_current_span("custom-operation") as span:
    span.set_attribute("task.id", task_id)
    # Perform operation
```

### Trace Visualization

Jaeger UI provides visualization of traces:
- URL: https://jaeger.internal.taskmanagement.com
- Key features:
  - Timeline view of spans across services
  - Filtering by service, operation, duration
  - Comparison of traces
  - Dependency graphs between services

### Using Traces for Troubleshooting

1. Identify problematic requests through logs or metrics
2. Find the corresponding trace ID in logs (`trace_id` field)
3. Search for the trace ID in Jaeger UI
4. Analyze the trace to identify:
   - Which service is causing delays
   - Where errors occur
   - Dependencies and their performance
   - Business context via span attributes

### Creating Custom Dashboards

To create custom dashboards:

1. Log in to Grafana with Editor or Admin privileges
2. Click "Create Dashboard"
3. Add panels with appropriate visualization types
4. Use PromQL queries to retrieve metrics
5. Consider these best practices:
   - Start with high-level metrics, then drill down
   - Use consistent color schemes (green=good, red=bad)
   - Include documentation links
   - Add panel descriptions for context
   - Use variables for filtering by service, instance, time range

**Example PromQL Queries**:

Request rate by service:
```
sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) by (service)
```

95th percentile response time:
```
histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le, service))
```

Error rate percentage:
```
sum(rate(http_requests_total{status_code=~"5.."}[5m])) by (service) / sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) by (service) * 100
```

## Alerting and Notification

### Alert Configuration

Alerts are defined in Prometheus AlertManager using alert rules. Alert definition files are stored in `/etc/prometheus/rules/` with service-specific rule files.

**Example Alert Rule**:
```yaml
groups:
- name: task-service-alerts
  rules:
  - alert: HighErrorRate
    expr: sum(rate(http_requests_total{service="task-service", status_code=~"5.."}[5m])) / sum(rate(http_requests_total{service="task-service"}[5m])) > 0.05
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: critical
      service: task-service
    annotations:
      summary: "High error rate in Task Service"
      description: "Task Service error rate is {{ $value | humanizePercentage }} over the last 5 minutes (threshold: 5%)"
      runbook_url: "https://wiki.internal.taskmanagement.com/runbooks/high-error-rate"
```

### Alert Severity Levels

| Severity | Description | Response Time | Notification Channels | Examples |
|----------|-------------|---------------|----------------------|----------|
| Critical (P1) | Service outage, data loss risk | 15 minutes | PagerDuty, SMS, Phone Call | Database unavailable, service down |
| High (P2) | Degraded service, customer impact | 30 minutes | PagerDuty, Slack | High error rates, significant latency |
| Medium (P3) | Minor impact, potential future issues | 4 hours | Slack, Email | Disk space warning, cache performance |
| Low (P4) | No immediate impact, informational | 24 hours | Email, Ticket | Resource trending upward, minor anomalies |

### Notification Channels

| Channel | Purpose | Configuration | Target Audience |
|---------|---------|---------------|----------------|
| PagerDuty | Urgent alerts (P1/P2) | Integration via webhook | On-call engineer |
| Slack | Team notifications (P2-P4) | #incidents channel | Engineering team |
| Email | Detailed notifications (P3/P4) | ops@taskmanagement.com | Operations team |
| Ticket | Tracking and assignment (P3/P4) | JIRA integration | Support team |

### On-Call Rotation

- Primary on-call rotation: 1 week per engineer
- Secondary backup: 1 week per engineer (staggered with primary)
- Handoff: Daily at 10:00 AM local time
- Escalation path: Primary → Secondary → Team Lead → Engineering Manager
- On-call schedule managed in PagerDuty

### Alert Silencing and Maintenance

During maintenance windows or for known issues:

1. Create silence in AlertManager:
   - URL: https://alertmanager.internal.taskmanagement.com/#/silences
   - Specify alert name, service, or other matchers
   - Set appropriate duration
   - Add reason and owner

2. For planned maintenance:
   - Create maintenance ticket in JIRA
   - Schedule silence 15 minutes before maintenance window
   - Extend duration beyond expected completion time
   - Notify operations channel in Slack

### Alert Response Workflow

1. **Alert Triggered**
   - Alert fires in Prometheus and routes to AlertManager
   - Notification sent to appropriate channels
   - On-call engineer acknowledges in PagerDuty

2. **Initial Assessment**
   - Check related dashboards and logs
   - Determine scope and impact
   - Update incident status in Slack channel

3. **Incident Response**
   - Follow runbook if available
   - Apply mitigation steps
   - Escalate if unable to resolve

4. **Resolution**
   - Fix the immediate issue
   - Verify metrics return to normal
   - Close alert in PagerDuty
   - Document resolution steps

5. **Post-Mortem**
   - Schedule post-mortem for P1/P2 incidents
   - Document root cause
   - Create tickets for preventive measures
   - Update runbooks as needed

## Health Checks

The system implements comprehensive health checks across all services to ensure reliable monitoring of service health and dependencies.

### Health Check Endpoints

All services expose the following health check endpoints:

| Endpoint | Purpose | Check Type | Usage |
|----------|---------|-----------|-------|
| `/health` | Basic health verification | Simple service liveness | Kubernetes liveness probe |
| `/health/readiness` | Service readiness for traffic | Database, cache, critical dependencies | Kubernetes readiness probe |
| `/health/liveness` | Detailed service health | Internal components and functionality | Detailed monitoring |
| `/health/db` | Database connectivity | Connection and query tests | Database monitoring |
| `/health/dependencies` | External dependency health | API calls to dependent services | Dependency monitoring |

### Health Check Implementation

The API Gateway implements these health checks as shown in the imported `health.py` file:

```python
@health_bp.route('/readiness', methods=['GET'])
def readiness():
    """
    Readiness check endpoint that verifies the service is ready to handle requests.
    
    This checks database connections and essential dependencies to ensure
    the service can properly handle incoming requests.
    
    Returns:
        Response: JSON response with readiness status details
    """
    # Check database connections
    mongo_status = check_mongo()
    redis_status = check_redis()
    
    # Determine if the service is ready based on database availability
    is_ready = mongo_status['available'] and redis_status['available']
    
    response = {
        'status': 'ready' if is_ready else 'not_ready',
        'timestamp': datetime.datetime.now().isoformat(),
        'service': current_app.config.get('SERVICE_NAME', 'api-gateway'),
        'version': current_app.config.get('API_VERSION', 'v1'),
        'databases': {
            'mongodb': mongo_status,
            'redis': redis_status
        }
    }
    
    return jsonify(response), 200 if is_ready else 503
```

### Health Check Monitoring

- **Prometheus Monitoring**: Health checks are scraped by Prometheus via blackbox exporter
- **Synthetic Monitoring**: Scheduled checks from multiple locations
- **Dashboard**: Health check status dashboard in Grafana
- **Alerts**: Configured for failed health checks:
  - 3 consecutive failures = warning
  - 5 consecutive failures = critical

### Implementing Health Checks in New Services

When adding health checks to a new service:

1. Implement the standard health check endpoints
2. Check all critical dependencies
3. Return appropriate HTTP status codes (200 for healthy, 503 for unhealthy)
4. Include detailed component status in the response body
5. Add the endpoints to Prometheus monitoring
6. Configure appropriate alerts

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators

| KPI | Metric Name | Target | Critical Threshold |
|-----|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| API Response Time | http_request_duration_seconds | p95 < 500ms | p95 > 1s |
| Database Query Time | db_query_duration_seconds | p95 < 100ms | p95 > 250ms |
| Task Creation Time | task_creation_duration_seconds | p95 < 2s | p95 > 5s |
| Service CPU Usage | process_cpu_seconds_total | < 70% | > 90% |
| Service Memory Usage | process_resident_memory_bytes | < 80% of limit | > 90% of limit |
| Cache Hit Ratio | cache_hit_ratio | > 80% | < 60% |
| Error Rate | http_requests_total{status_code=~"5.."} | < 0.1% | > 1% |

### Performance Baselines

Performance baselines are established through:

1. **Controlled Load Testing**:
   - Regular load tests in staging environment
   - Measure key metrics under normal and peak load
   - Document baseline metrics and acceptable ranges

2. **Production Analysis**:
   - Analyze 30-day performance trends
   - Establish daily/weekly patterns
   - Document expected performance by time period

Baseline metrics are stored in a dedicated Prometheus recording rules file for easy reference and comparison.

### Identifying Performance Bottlenecks

To identify performance bottlenecks:

1. **Service-Level Analysis**:
   - Check high-level service metrics (latency, throughput, errors)
   - Compare against baselines and SLAs
   - Identify services with degraded performance

2. **Resource Analysis**:
   - Examine CPU, memory, I/O, and network metrics
   - Look for resource saturation
   - Check for correlation with performance degradation

3. **Database Analysis**:
   - Analyze query performance metrics
   - Check for slow queries
   - Look for lock contention or replication lag

4. **Dependency Analysis**:
   - Check downstream service performance
   - Analyze external API call metrics
   - Look for correlation with service degradation

5. **Trace Analysis**:
   - Find traces for slow requests
   - Identify the slowest spans
   - Analyze span attributes for context

### Optimization Process

When performance issues are identified:

1. **Gather Data**:
   - Collect metrics, logs, and traces
   - Reproduce if possible
   - Document impact and conditions

2. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Determine if issue is code, configuration, or resource related
   - Analyze patterns and correlations
   - Identify specific bottlenecks

3. **Solution Design**:
   - Develop optimization strategy
   - Consider code, query, or architecture changes
   - Evaluate resource scaling options

4. **Implementation and Testing**:
   - Implement changes in staging
   - Conduct load testing
   - Verify performance improvement

5. **Deployment and Monitoring**:
   - Deploy to production
   - Monitor key metrics
   - Verify performance gains
   - Document improvements and lessons learned

## Incident Response

### Alert Triage Process

When an alert is triggered:

1. **Acknowledge the Alert**:
   - Acknowledge in PagerDuty within 5 minutes
   - Join the incident channel in Slack
   - Announce you're investigating

2. **Assess Severity and Impact**:
   - Check impacted service dashboards
   - Determine user impact scope
   - Verify if multiple alerts are related
   - Classify incident severity (P1-P4)

3. **Initial Investigation**:
   - Check recent deployments or changes
   - Review logs and metrics

### Incident Management Process

For active incidents:

1. **Establish Incident Command**:
   - For P1/P2: Assign Incident Commander (IC)
   - For P3/P4: On-call engineer leads

2. **Mitigation First**:
   - Focus on service restoration
   - Apply temporary mitigations if needed
   - Consider failover or rollback options
   - Document actions taken

3. **Diagnostic Data Collection**:
   - Capture logs, metrics, and state
   - Preserve evidence for root cause analysis
   - Take screenshots of relevant dashboards
   - Document timeline of events

4. **Resolution**:
   - Implement permanent fix when identified
   - Verify metrics return to normal
   - Test affected functionality
   - Update status and close incident

### Escalation Procedures

| Severity | Initial Responder | When to Escalate | Escalation Path |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| P1 | On-call Engineer | After 15 min without progress | Secondary → Team Lead → Engineering Director |
| P2 | On-call Engineer | After 30 min without progress | Secondary → Team Lead |
| P3 | On-call Engineer | After 2 hours without progress | Team Lead |
| P4 | On-call Engineer | After 8 hours without progress | Team Lead |

**Escalation Contact Information**:
- Stored in PagerDuty escalation policies
- Available in the internal wiki: https://wiki.internal.taskmanagement.com/escalation

## Deployment Monitoring

### Deployment Health Metrics

During and after deployments, monitor these key metrics:

| Metric | Normal Range | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Error Rate Delta | < 2x baseline | 2-5x baseline | > 5x baseline |
| Latency Increase | < 25% | 25-50% | > 50% |
| CPU Utilization | < 80% | 80-90% | > 90% |
| Memory Utilization | < 80% | 80-90% | > 90% |
| Successful Health Checks | 100% | 90-99% | < 90% |
| 5xx Rate | < 0.1% | 0.1-1% | > 1% |

### Pre-Deployment Validation

Before each deployment:

1. **Baseline Metrics**:
   - Record current performance metrics
   - Note any existing issues or deviations
   - Establish comparison thresholds

2. **Synthetic Tests**:
   - Run pre-deployment synthetic checks
   - Verify critical user journeys
   - Validate integration points

3. **Alert Suppression**:
   - Configure temporary alert silences
   - Set silence duration to cover deployment window plus buffer
   - Document silenced alerts

### Deployment Tracking Dashboard

A dedicated deployment dashboard is available at:
https://grafana.internal.taskmanagement.com/d/deployments

Features include:
- Deployment event markers on metrics graphs
- Before/after metric comparisons
- Health check status tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Response time tracking
- Automated canary analysis

### Rollback Triggers

Automatic rollback is triggered by:
- Error rate increasing by 5x compared to baseline
- P95 latency increasing by 50% for more than 5 minutes
- Health check success rate dropping below 80%
- Any critical alerts related to the deployed service

Manual rollback should be considered when:
- Unexpected behavior not caught by automated checks
- Subtle functional issues reported by users
- Performance degradation in dependent services
- Error rates trending upward but below automatic thresholds

### Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment completes:

1. **Metric Verification**:
   - Check error rates against baseline
   - Verify latency remains within acceptable range
   - Monitor resource utilization

2. **Functional Verification**:
   - Run post-deployment synthetic tests
   - Verify all critical user journeys
   - Test new functionality

3. **Monitoring Adjustment**:
   - Tune alert thresholds if needed
   - Update dashboards for new metrics
   - Create new alerts for new failure modes

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update deployment runbook with any issues
   - Document metric changes for future reference

|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| False positives | Threshold too sensitive | Review alert definition, adjust thresholds |
| Missed alerts | Threshold too lenient | Review incident data, adjust thresholds |
| Alert storm | Cascading failures | Use alert grouping, implement dependency-aware alerting |

### Debug Procedures

#### Investigating Service Health Issues

1. **Check the service health endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl https://api.taskmanagement.com/health/liveness
   ```

2. **Verify metrics in Prometheus**:
   - Open Prometheus UI: https://prometheus.internal.taskmanagement.com
   - Query for service instance information:
     ```
     app_instance_info{service="<service-name>"}
     ```
   - Check for error rates:
     ```
     sum(rate(http_requests_total{service="<service-name>", status_code=~"5.."}[5m]))
     ```

3. **Check recent logs in Kibana**:
   - Open Kibana: https://kibana.internal.taskmanagement.com
   - Search for service logs:
     ```
     service: "<service-name>" AND level: "ERROR"
     ```
   - Look for patterns or recurring errors

4. **Check dependencies**:
   ```bash
   curl https://api.taskmanagement.com/health/dependencies
   ```

#### Diagnosing Performance Issues

1. **Analyze latency metrics**:
   - Check percentile latency:
     ```
     histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{service="<service-name>"}[5m])) by (le, path))
     ```
   - Compare with baseline

2. **Check resource utilization**:
   - CPU usage:
     ```
     rate(process_cpu_seconds_total{service="<service-name>"}[5m]) * 100
     ```
   - Memory usage:
     ```
     process_resident_memory_bytes{service="<service-name>"} / 1024 / 1024
     ```

3. **Analyze database performance**:
   - Query execution time:
     ```
     histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(db_query_duration_seconds_bucket{service="<service-name>"}[5m])) by (le, operation))
     ```
   - Connection pool metrics:
     ```
     db_connection_pool_usage{service="<service-name>"}
     ```

4. **Check trace data in Jaeger**:
   - Find slow traces for the service
   - Identify bottlenecks within spans
   - Look for slow database queries or external calls

### System Recovery Procedures

#### Recovering from Service Failures

1. **Restart the service**:
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout restart deployment <service-name>
   ```

2. **Check logs during restart**:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -f deployment/<service-name> -n task-management
   ```

3. **Verify health after restart**:
   ```bash
   curl https://api.taskmanagement.com/health/readiness
   ```

#### Recovering from Database Issues

1. **Check MongoDB connection status**:
   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it <mongodb-pod> -- mongo --eval "rs.status()"
   ```

2. **Restart problematic database instances**:
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout restart statefulset mongodb -n task-management
   ```

3. **Verify replication status**:
   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it <mongodb-pod> -- mongo --eval "rs.status().members.forEach(function(m) { print(m.name + ': ' + m.stateStr) })"
   ```

#### Recovering from Cache Issues

1. **Check Redis status**:
   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it <redis-pod> -- redis-cli ping
   ```

2. **Flush cache if corrupted**:
   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it <redis-pod> -- redis-cli flushall
   ```

3. **Restart Redis if needed**:
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout restart statefulset redis -n task-management
   ```
