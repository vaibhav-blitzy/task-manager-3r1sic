# Task Management System: Deployment Guide

## Introduction

This document provides comprehensive guidance for deploying the Task Management System to various environments. It outlines the deployment pipeline, infrastructure provisioning, deployment strategies, and operational procedures required for reliable, repeatable deployments.

### Deployment Philosophy

The Task Management System follows a deployment philosophy centered on:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure is defined and provisioned through Terraform
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Deployments replace entire environments rather than modifying existing resources
- **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive testing at every stage of deployment
- **Progressive Delivery**: Changes flow from development to staging to production with appropriate validation
- **Rollback Capability**: All deployments can be quickly rolled back if issues are detected
- **Zero-Downtime Deployments**: Users experience no interruption during deployments
- **Observability**: Every deployment is monitored for success and impact on system health

### Key Objectives

- Ensure consistent and reliable deployments across all environments
- Minimize deployment risk through automation and validation
- Provide clear procedures for both routine and emergency deployments
- Establish governance and approval processes for production changes
- Enable rapid incident response for deployment-related issues

## CI/CD Pipeline

The Task Management System uses a robust CI/CD pipeline to automate building, testing, and deploying the application across environments.

### Build Process

The build process creates containerized artifacts from source code and prepares them for deployment:

1. **Trigger**: Initiated by code push to main branch or pull request
2. **Checkout**: Clone repository
3. **Dependency Installation**: Download and install dependencies
4. **Static Analysis**: Run linters and code quality checks
5. **Unit Tests**: Execute unit tests
6. **Build**: Compile code and package assets
7. **Container Build**: Create Docker images
8. **Security Scan**: Scan containers for vulnerabilities
9. **Artifact Publishing**: Push images to Amazon ECR with environment-specific tags

**Quality Gates**:
- Unit tests must pass
- No critical or high security vulnerabilities
- Code coverage above 85%
- Static analysis shows no critical issues

### Deployment Process

The deployment process promotes built artifacts through the environment pipeline:

#### Development Deployment

1. **Trigger**: Successful build on main branch
2. **Environment Preparation**:
   - Update ECS task definitions with new image tags
   - Register new task definitions in ECS
3. **Deployment**:
   - Execute rolling deployment to ECS development cluster
   - Update services with new task definitions
   - Force new deployment to replace existing containers
4. **Validation**:
   - Run health checks against deployed services
   - Execute smoke tests against key endpoints
   - Verify metrics for error rate spikes
5. **Notification**:
   - Notify development team of successful deployment
   - Update deployment tracking in CI/CD system

#### Staging Deployment

1. **Trigger**: Successful development deployment and approval
2. **Environment Preparation**:
   - Update Terraform variables with new image tags
   - Create new blue environment with updated images
3. **Deployment**:
   - Apply Terraform changes to create blue environment
   - Wait for blue environment to become healthy
4. **Testing**:
   - Run integration test suite against blue environment
   - Run security scans against new deployment
   - Execute performance tests if applicable
5. **Traffic Shifting**:
   - Gradually shift traffic from green to blue environment
   - Monitor for errors during transition
   - Complete shift to 100% blue
6. **Cleanup**:
   - Scale down green environment after successful transition
   - Maintain green for potential rollback

#### Production Deployment

1. **Trigger**: Successful staging deployment and approval
2. **Environment Preparation**:
   - Update Terraform variables with production image tags
   - Create new blue environment with zero traffic
3. **Initial Deployment**:

   - Wait for blue environment to become healthy
4. **Smoke Testing**:
   - Run smoke tests against blue environment
   - Verify critical functionality
5. **Canary Release**:
   - Send 10% of traffic to blue environment
   - Monitor key metrics for 5 minutes
   - If successful, increase to 30% for 5 minutes
   - If successful, increase to 50% for 5 minutes
   - If successful, increase to 100%
6. **Post-Deployment Validation**:
   - Run full validation test suite
   - Monitor application metrics for 30 minutes
   - Verify logs for unexpected errors
7. **Finalization**:
   - Scale down green environment
   - Create deployment tag in git
   - Send deployment notification

### Rollback Procedures

In case of deployment failures, the system provides automated and manual rollback capabilities:

#### Automated Rollback Triggers

The deployment will automatically roll back if:
- Health checks fail repeatedly during deployment
- Error rate increases by 5x compared to baseline
- P95 latency increases by 50% for more than 5 minutes
- Any critical alerts are triggered during deployment

#### Development Rollback Procedure

1. Revert to previous task definition revision:
   ```bash
   aws ecs update-service --cluster task-management-dev \
     --service task-management-service-dev \
     --task-definition task-management-dev:$PREVIOUS_REVISION \
     --force-new-deployment
   ```

2. Wait for service to stabilize:
   ```bash
   aws ecs wait services-stable \
     --cluster task-management-dev \
     --services task-management-service-dev
   ```

3. Verify health and functionality after rollback.

#### Staging/Production Rollback Procedure

1. For blue-green deployments, switch traffic back to the green environment:
   ```bash
   terraform apply -auto-approve \
     -var="environment=production" \
     -var="deployment_color=green" \
     -var="traffic_distribution=100"
   ```

2. If both environments are unhealthy, restore from the most recent known good deployment:
   ```bash
   aws ecs update-service --cluster task-management-prod \
     --service task-management-service-prod \
     --task-definition task-management-prod:$LAST_GOOD_REVISION \
     --force-new-deployment
   ```

3. Verify health and functionality after rollback.

## Deployment Strategies

The Task Management System uses different deployment strategies based on the environment and risk profile.

### Rolling Deployment

Used in the development environment for frequent, lower-risk deployments.

**Implementation**:
1. Update ECS task definition with new container image
2. Update service to use new task definition
3. ECS gradually replaces tasks, maintaining minimum healthy percentage (default: 100%)
4. New tasks must pass health checks before old tasks are terminated

**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "deploymentConfiguration": {
    "maximumPercent": 200,
    "minimumHealthyPercent": 100,
    "deploymentCircuitBreaker": {
      "enable": true,
      "rollback": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Advantages**:
- Simple and well-understood
- Resource efficient
- Requires no additional infrastructure

**Disadvantages**:
- Brief reduction in capacity during transitions
- Cannot easily be aborted once started
- Verification happens in production environment

### Blue-Green Deployment

Used in the staging environment to provide cleaner separation between versions.

**Implementation**:
1. Deploy new version (blue) alongside current version (green)
2. Verify blue environment is functioning correctly
3. Switch traffic from green to blue by updating load balancer target groups
4. Keep green environment available for potential rollback
5. Decommission green environment after successful transition

**Configuration** (via Terraform):
```hcl
module "alb" {
  # ... other configuration
  blue_target_group_weight  = var.traffic_distribution
  green_target_group_weight = 100 - var.traffic_distribution
}
```

**Advantages**:
- Clean separation between versions
- Easy and fast rollback
- No capacity reduction during deployment
- Full testing before traffic transition

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires double the resources during deployment
- More complex infrastructure
- More expensive than rolling deployment

### Canary Deployment

Used in the production environment to minimize risk with progressive traffic shifting.

**Implementation**:
1. Deploy new version (blue) with 0% traffic
2. Verify blue environment health
3. Shift small percentage (10%) of traffic to blue
4. Monitor health, performance, and errors
5. Gradually increase traffic in steps (10% → 30% → 50% → 100%)
6. Roll back immediately if issues are detected
7. Decommission old version after successful transition

**Configuration** (via Terraform):
```hcl
# Traffic weights are set incrementally during deployment
module "alb" {
  # ... other configuration
  blue_target_group_weight  = 10  # Start with 10% traffic
  green_target_group_weight = 90  # 90% to existing environment
}
```

**Advantages**:
- Minimizes risk by exposing small user base to new version
- Provides early warning of issues before full deployment
- Allows performance comparison between versions
- Easy rollback at any stage

**Disadvantages**:
- Slowest deployment method
- Requires managing multiple active versions
- Requires sophisticated monitoring
- Most complex to implement

## Infrastructure as Code

The Task Management System uses Terraform to define and provision infrastructure across all environments.

### Terraform Structure

The Terraform code is organized as follows:

```
infrastructure/
├── terraform/
│   ├── modules/            # Reusable infrastructure components
│   │   ├── vpc/            # Networking configuration
│   │   ├── ecs/            # Container orchestration
│   │   ├── documentdb/     # MongoDB-compatible database
│   │   ├── elasticache/    # Redis caching
│   │   ├── alb/            # Load balancing
│   │   └── ...             # Other infrastructure components
│   │
│   ├── environments/       # Environment-specific configurations
│   │   ├── dev/            # Development environment
│   │   ├── staging/        # Staging environment
│   │   └── prod/           # Production environment
│   │
│   └── global/             # Global resources shared across environments
│       ├── dns/            # Route53 configuration
│       ├── monitoring/     # CloudWatch dashboards and alerts
│       └── iam/            # Identity and access management
```

### Resource Management

All AWS resources should be managed through Terraform to maintain consistency and avoid configuration drift:

1. **State Management**:
   - Terraform state stored in S3 buckets with versioning enabled
   - State locking via DynamoDB tables
   - Separate state files for each environment

2. **Variable Management**:
   - Environment-specific variables in `terraform.tfvars` files
   - Sensitive values stored in AWS Secrets Manager and referenced in Terraform
   - Common variables defined in `variables.tf`

3. **Module Versioning**:
   - Pin module versions for stability
   - Use semantic versioning for modules
   - Test module changes in lower environments before promotion

### Infrastructure Updates

When updating infrastructure components:

1. **Plan Changes**:
   ```bash
   terraform plan -var-file=environments/prod/terraform.tfvars -out=prod.tfplan
   ```

2. **Review Planned Changes**:
   - Examine resource additions, modifications, and destructions
   - Verify changes align with intended modifications
   - Pay special attention to any resource replacements

3. **Schedule Changes**:
   - For production, schedule infrastructure changes during maintenance windows
   - Communicate planned changes to stakeholders
   - Ensure monitoring is in place

4. **Apply Changes**:
   ```bash
   terraform apply prod.tfplan
   ```

5. **Verify Changes**:
   - Confirm resources were created/modified as expected
   - Run validation tests appropriate for the changed components
   - Monitor for any unexpected behavior

6. **Rollback if Necessary**:
   - If issues arise, restore previous state:
   ```bash
   terraform apply -var-file=environments/prod/terraform.tfvars -target=MODULE.RESOURCE
   ```

## Container Deployment

The Task Management System uses AWS ECS with Fargate for container orchestration and deployment.

### Container Registry Management

Amazon ECR is used to store and version container images:

1. **Repository Structure**:
   - Repositories named after services: `task-management-system/[service-name]`
   - Images tagged with git commit hash and environment: `[hash]-[env]`
   - Latest images also tagged with `latest-[env]`

2. **Image Lifecycle**:
   - Development images retained for 14 days
   - Staging images retained for 30 days
   - Production images retained for 90 days
   - Untagged images removed after 7 days

3. **Image Scanning**:
   - All images scanned on push
   - Daily rescanning of deployed images
   - Alerts for critical vulnerabilities

### Task Definition Updates

When deploying new container versions:

1. **Create New Revision**:
   ```bash
   # Extract current task definition
   aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition $TASK_FAMILY \
     --query 'taskDefinition' > task-def.json
   
   # Update container image in task definition
   jq '.containerDefinitions[0].image = "$NEW_IMAGE"' task-def.json > new-task-def.json
   
   # Register new task definition
   aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://new-task-def.json
   ```

2. **Update Service**:
   ```bash
   aws ecs update-service \
     --cluster $CLUSTER_NAME \
     --service $SERVICE_NAME \
     --task-definition $TASK_FAMILY:$REVISION \
     --force-new-deployment
   ```

3. **Monitor Deployment**:
   ```bash
   aws ecs describe-services \
     --cluster $CLUSTER_NAME \
     --services $SERVICE_NAME \
     --query 'services[0].deployments'
   ```

### Service Discovery

Services communicate with each other using AWS Service Discovery:

1. **Service Namespacing**:
   - Services register with internal namespace `service.local`
   - Each service accessible via `[service-name].service.local`

2. **Health Checks**:
   - Health check path: `/health`
   - Interval: 30 seconds
   - Timeout: 5 seconds
   - Threshold: 2 failures = unhealthy

3. **Service Configuration**:
   ```json
   {
     "serviceRegistries": [
       {
         "registryArn": "arn:aws:servicediscovery:region:account:service/srv-xxxxxxxxxx"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

## Configuration Management

The Task Management System uses a layered approach to configuration management.

### Environment Variables

Container environment variables provide runtime configuration:

1. **Base Variables**: Common across all environments, defined in Dockerfile
2. **Environment Variables**: Specific to each environment, injected via ECS task definitions
3. **Secret Variables**: Sensitive values retrieved from AWS Secrets Manager

**Example Task Definition Environment Configuration**:
```json
"containerDefinitions": [
  {
    "name": "api-gateway",
    "environment": [
      {
        "name": "FLASK_ENV",
        "value": "production"
      },
      {
        "name": "LOG_LEVEL",
        "value": "INFO"
      }
    ],
    "secrets": [
      {
        "name": "MONGODB_URI",
        "valueFrom": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:region:account:secret:mongodb-uri-xxxxxx"
      },
      {
        "name": "REDIS_PASSWORD",
        "valueFrom": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:region:account:secret:redis-password-xxxxxx"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Secrets Management

Sensitive configuration values are stored in AWS Secrets Manager:

1. **Secret Organization**:
   - Secrets grouped by environment and service
   - Naming pattern: `[env]/[service]/[secret-name]`

2. **Secret Access**:
   - Services granted read-only access via IAM roles
   - Access logs audited via CloudTrail
   - Automatic rotation enabled for applicable secrets

3. **Retrieving Secrets**:
   - During service startup, environment pulls secrets
   - Values cached locally with periodic refresh
   - Secrets service automatically retries on failure

### Parameter Store

AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store manages non-sensitive configuration:

1. **Parameter Organization**:
   - Parameters organized in hierarchical structure
   - Naming pattern: `/[env]/[service]/[parameter-name]`

2. **Parameter Types**:
   - String: Simple configuration values
   - StringList: Comma-separated values
   - SecureString: Encrypted values (for moderately sensitive data)

3. **Versioning**:
   - Parameter history preserved
   - Services reference specific parameter versions or latest
   - Parameter changes logged for audit

**Example Parameter Structure**:
```
/production/api-gateway/allowed-origins
/production/api-gateway/rate-limits
/production/task-service/default-pagination
```

## Database Deployments

Database changes require special handling to ensure data integrity and availability.

### Schema Migrations

MongoDB schema changes are managed through the application:

1. **Migration Framework**:
   - Python-based migration scripts
   - Version tracking in dedicated collection
   - Idempotent operations for safety

2. **Migration Process**:
   ```bash
   # Run migrations during deployment
   python manage.py migrate --database mongodb
   ```

3. **Migration Safety Measures**:
   - Backward compatible changes only
   - Pre-deployment testing with production-like data
   - Ability to roll back changes if needed

### Data Migrations

For significant data structure changes:

1. **Pre-Deployment**:
   - Create data migration plan
   - Estimate migration duration
   - Schedule maintenance window if necessary
   - Take database snapshot before migration

2. **Migration Execution**:
   - Run migration in separate process
   - Monitor progress and performance
   - Implement throttling to prevent overload

3. **Verification**:
   - Validate migrated data integrity
   - Run data consistency checks
   - Verify application functionality with new structure

### Backup and Restore

Before any database change:

1. **Automated Backup**:
   - Full database snapshot created pre-deployment
   - Backup retention based on environment:
     - Development: 3 days
     - Staging: 7 days
     - Production: 30 days

2. **Restore Procedure**:
   ```bash
   # Restore MongoDB from snapshot if needed
   aws docdb restore-db-cluster-from-snapshot \
     --db-cluster-identifier $CLUSTER_ID \
     --snapshot-identifier $SNAPSHOT_ID
   ```

3. **Testing Restore**:
   - Regularly test restore procedures
   - Verify data consistency after restore
   - Document restore time for DR planning

## Release Management

Effective release management ensures coordinated deployment of changes.

### Release Calendar

All releases should be planned and scheduled:

1. **Release Cadence**:
   - Development: Continuous (multiple times daily)
   - Staging: Daily
   - Production: Weekly (Tuesdays, 10:00 AM EST)

## Monitoring Deployments

Monitoring is critical to ensure successful deployments and early detection of issues.

### Deployment Metrics

Key metrics to monitor during and after deployments:

1. **Service Health**:
   - Error rate: Should not increase by more than 2x baseline
   - Latency: P95 should not increase by more than 25%
   - Success rate: Should remain above 99.5%

2. **Infrastructure Metrics**:
   - CPU utilization: Should not exceed 80%
   - Memory utilization: Should not exceed 80%
   - Network traffic: Should follow expected patterns
   - Database connection count: Should not exceed 80% of limit

3. **Business Metrics**:
   - Task creation rate: Should remain consistent
   - User activity: Should not drop significantly
   - Feature usage: New features should show adoption

### Health Checks

Deployment validation via service health endpoints:

1. **Endpoint Types**:
   - Basic health: `/health` - Simple service liveness
   - Readiness: `/health/readiness` - Service ability to handle traffic
   - Dependencies: `/health/dependencies` - Status of dependent services
   - DB health: `/health/db` - Database connectivity

2. **Implementation**:
   The API Gateway health checks are implemented as shown below:
   ```python
   @health_bp.route('/readiness', methods=['GET'])
   def readiness():
       """
       Readiness check endpoint that verifies the service is ready to handle requests.
       
       This checks database connections and essential dependencies to ensure
       the service can properly handle incoming requests.
       
       Returns:
           Response: JSON response with readiness status details
       """
       # Check database connections
       mongo_status = check_mongo()
       redis_status = check_redis()

3. **Validation Process**:
   - Pre-deployment: Verify current health
   - During deployment: Check new instances as they come online
   - Post-deployment: Monitor for 15+ minutes after completion

### Deployment Verification

Automated verification ensures deployment success:

1. **Smoke Tests**:
   - Run immediately after deployment
   - Tests basic functionality
   - Covers critical user paths
   - Fast execution (< 2 minutes)

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Run after successful smoke tests
   - Tests service interactions
   - Covers main business flows
   - Moderate execution time (< 15 minutes)

3. **Performance Validation**:
   - Compare key performance metrics pre/post deployment
   - Check for degradation in response times
   - Verify resource utilization is within expected ranges
   - Alert on abnormal patterns

Deployment is considered successful when:
- All health checks pass
- Smoke tests and integration tests pass
- Performance metrics remain within acceptable ranges
- No unexpected errors in logs
- No alerts triggered within 30 minutes post-deployment

## Incident Response

Procedures for addressing deployment-related incidents.

### Deployment Failures

When a deployment fails, follow these steps:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Halt deployment if in progress
   - Execute rollback procedure appropriate for environment
   - Notify relevant team members via Slack and PagerDuty
   - Update status page if user impact occurred

2. **Diagnosis**:
   - Collect logs from failed deployment
   - Review error messages and stack traces
   - Check infrastructure status and health metrics
   - Identify failure point (build, deploy, or post-deploy)

3. **Communication**:
   - Update status on incident channel
   - Provide regular updates (every 15-30 minutes)
   - Clearly communicate ETA when available
   - Document all actions taken

**Example Rollback Command for Development**:
```bash
aws ecs update-service \
  --cluster task-management-dev \
  --service task-management-service-dev \
  --task-definition task-management-dev:$PREVIOUS_REVISION \
  --force-new-deployment
```

### Service Disruptions

For deployment-related service disruptions:

1. **Impact Assessment**:
   - Determine affected services and features
   - Estimate user impact scope
   - Evaluate business impact
   - Assign severity level (P1-P4)

2. **Mitigation Steps**:
   - For P1/P2: Rollback immediately to last known good state
   - For P3/P4: Consider fix-forward if solution is clear and quick
   - Implement temporary workarounds if available
   - Scale resources if performance-related

3. **Recovery Verification**:
   - Run validation tests after mitigation
   - Verify service health metrics have normalized
   - Check business metrics for recovery
   - Confirm full functionality through critical path testing

### Post-Incident Reviews

After resolving deployment incidents:

1. **Schedule Review**:
   - Within 3 business days of resolution
   - Include all stakeholders in the deployment process
   - Schedule for 60-90 minutes

2. **Prepare Documentation**:
   - Incident timeline
   - Root cause analysis
   - Impact assessment
   - Action items

3. **Meeting Agenda**:
   - Review incident timeline
   - Identify what went well
   - Identify improvement areas
   - Assign action items

4. **Follow-up**:
   - Document findings in knowledge base
   - Update deployment procedures
   - Add new tests to prevent recurrence
   - Implement process improvements

## Security Considerations

Security practices for the deployment process.

### Deployment Permissions

Least privilege access for deployment operations:

1. **Role-Based Access**:
   - CI/CD pipeline: Limited deployment rights only
   - DevOps team: Infrastructure modification rights
   - Developers: Read-only access to production
   - Everyone: Full access to development environment

2. **Key IAM Roles**:
   - `tms-deployment-role`: Used by CI/CD pipeline
   - `tms-operations-role`: Used by DevOps team
   - `tms-readonly-role`: Used by developers
   - `tms-emergency-access`: Break-glass role with full access

3. **Permission Boundaries**:
   - Environment-specific roles
   - Service-specific permissions
   - Time-limited elevated access

### Security Scanning

Integrated security verification throughout deployment:

1. **Container Scanning**:
   - Image scanning before deployment
   - Vulnerability assessment
   - Software composition analysis
   - No critical or high vulnerabilities allowed

2. **Infrastructure Scanning**:
   - Terraform plan security analysis
   - AWS resource configuration compliance
   - Network security group validation
   - CIS benchmark compliance

3. **Application Scanning**:
   - SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
   - DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - API security testing

### Compliance Verification

Ensure deployments maintain compliance requirements:

1. **Pre-Deployment Checks**:
   - Run compliance validation scripts
   - Verify security configurations
   - Check against compliance requirements
   - Validate required security controls

2. **Audit Trail**:
   - Log all deployment activities
   - Record approvals and changes
   - Maintain artifact provenance
   - Document compliance evidence

3. **Post-Deployment Verification**:
   - Run compliance scans after deployment
   - Verify encryption at rest and in transit
   - Check authentication and authorization
   - Validate logging and monitoring
