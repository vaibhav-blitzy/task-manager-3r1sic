# Security Policy

This document outlines security procedures, features, and policies for the Task Management System.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within the Task Management System, please follow these steps for responsible disclosure:

1. **Do not** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed by our team.
2. Email security-team@taskmanagement.example.com with details of the vulnerability.
3. Include a clear description, steps to reproduce, and potential impact if possible.
4. We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
5. We will provide regular updates on our progress addressing the issue.
6. Once the vulnerability is fixed, we may invite you to confirm the fix.

We strive to resolve all vulnerabilities promptly based on severity:
- Critical vulnerabilities: 24-48 hours
- High vulnerabilities: 1 week
- Medium vulnerabilities: 2 weeks
- Low vulnerabilities: 1 month

## Security Features

The Task Management System implements several security measures to protect user data and system integrity:

### Authentication and Authorization

- JWT-based authentication with short-lived access tokens (15 minutes) and longer refresh tokens (7 days)
- Secure token storage and rotation for refresh tokens
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with hierarchical permissions
- Resource-level authorization checks
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support with multiple methods (TOTP, SMS, Email)
- Progressive account lockout after multiple failed login attempts
- Secure password reset flow with time-limited tokens

### Data Protection

- Passwords stored using bcrypt with per-user salt
- AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive stored data
- TLS 1.3 for all data in transit
- Field-level encryption for particularly sensitive information
- Data masking for sensitive data in logs and displays
- Secure data sanitization and validation to prevent injection attacks

### API Security

- Rate limiting to prevent abuse and DoS attacks
- JWT token validation with appropriate algorithm (RS256)
- CSRF protection for relevant endpoints
- Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- Detailed error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Standardized security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)

### Infrastructure Security

- Containerized services with least privilege principles
- Regular security scanning of container images using Trivy
- Runtime security monitoring with Falco
- Network segmentation and security groups
- Regular security patching and updates
- Defense in depth with multiple security layers

### Monitoring and Incident Response

- Comprehensive security logging and monitoring
- Automated alerts for suspicious activities
- Defined incident response procedures
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing
- Continuous vulnerability scanning and management

## Security Best Practices for Development

When contributing to the Task Management System, please follow these security best practices:

### Secure Coding

- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Properly validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Use secure defaults and fail securely
- Apply the principle of defense in depth

### Authentication and Authorization

- Always use the system's authentication and permission frameworks
- Never implement custom authentication bypass mechanisms
- Check authorization for all sensitive operations
- Never hardcode credentials or tokens in the codebase

### Data Protection

- Use the provided encryption utilities for sensitive data
- Minimize storage of sensitive data
- Apply proper data sanitization before display
- Be mindful of data in logs and error messages

### Dependency Management

- Keep dependencies updated to their secure versions
- Review security advisories for used packages
- Use dependency lock files to prevent unexpected updates
- Minimize use of third-party libraries for security-critical functions

## Compliance

The Task Management System is designed to comply with various security standards and regulations, including:

- SOC 2: Service Organization Control 2
- GDPR: General Data Protection Regulation
- CCPA: California Consumer Privacy Act
- HIPAA: When applicable for deployments handling protected health information

Our security practices are regularly reviewed and updated to maintain compliance with these standards.

## Security Updates and Communications

We communicate security updates through multiple channels:

- Release notes in our GitHub repository
- Email notifications for registered administrators
- Security advisories for critical issues

We recommend subscribing to these channels to stay informed about important security updates.

## Acknowledgments

We value the security research community and appreciate the efforts of security researchers who help improve our system's security. Responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security and privacy of our users.
