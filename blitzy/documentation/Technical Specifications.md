### 4.3 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

#### 4.3.1 Task State Management

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Created: User creates task
    
    Created --> Assigned: Task assigned to user
    Created --> InProgress: Creator starts work
    
    Assigned --> InProgress: Assignee starts work
    Assigned --> Declined: Assignee declines
    Declined --> Assigned: Reassigned to another user
    
    InProgress --> OnHold: Work paused
    OnHold --> InProgress: Work resumed
    
    InProgress --> InReview: Work completed, needs review
    InReview --> InProgress: Changes requested
    InReview --> Completed: Approved by reviewer
    
    InProgress --> Completed: Work completed (no review)
    
    Completed --> Archived: Task archived after 30 days
    Archived --> [*]
    
    Created --> Cancelled: Task cancelled
    Assigned --> Cancelled: Task cancelled
    InProgress --> Cancelled: Task cancelled
    OnHold --> Cancelled: Task cancelled
    InReview --> Cancelled: Task cancelled
    
    Cancelled --> Archived: Task archived after 30 days
```

**State Transition Rules:**
- Only task creator, assignee, or manager can change task state
- State changes generate system events for notification and logging
- Completed tasks cannot be returned to InProgress without manager approval
- Tasks in Declined state must be reassigned within 24 hours
- Only tasks in Completed or Cancelled state can be archived

**Data Persistence:**
- Each state change stored with timestamp and user information
- Task history maintained for audit and reporting purposes
- Caching of current task state for performance optimization
- Transaction boundaries ensure complete state transitions

    RetryCount -->|No| FinalFailure[Handle Final Failure]
    
    IsRetryable -->|No| ReportError[Report to User]
    ReportError --> EndNode
    FinalFailure --> EndNode
```

**Retry Mechanisms:**

- Dead letter queues for unprocessable events
- Selective retries based on operation idempotence

**Recovery Procedures:**
- Automated recovery for non-destructive operations
- Manual intervention required for critical data errors
- Session recovery for authentication failures
- Database transaction rollback on persistence failures
- Graceful degradation for non-critical service failures

    end
```

**Data Flow Considerations:**
- Event-driven architecture for decoupled service communication
- API Gateway handles authentication, rate limiting, and request routing
- Cache invalidation triggered by relevant data mutations
- External service failures isolated through circuit breakers
- Event sourcing for critical data changes enabling audit and replay

**Transaction Boundaries:**
- Database transactions limited to single service operations
- Eventual consistency model for cross-service operations
- Idempotent API operations supporting safe retries
- Distributed transactions avoided in favor of compensating actions
- Event acknowledgment ensures reliable processing

## 5. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### 5.1 HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE

#### 5.1.1 System Overview

The Task Management System implements a microservices architecture pattern to achieve modularity, scalability, and maintainability. This architectural approach decomposes the application into loosely coupled, independently deployable services that communicate through well-defined APIs. The system follows several key architectural principles:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each microservice focuses on a specific business capability (authentication, task management, notifications, etc.)
- **API-First Design**: All services expose REST APIs for standardized communication
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Real-time updates and cross-service communication utilize event streams
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service owns its data and business logic
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect sensitive user data

The system establishes clear boundaries between frontend components, backend services, and external integrations. The browser-based client application communicates with backend services through a unified API Gateway that handles routing, authentication, and request validation. Internal services communicate through a combination of synchronous (REST) and asynchronous (event-based) patterns depending on the operation requirements.

#### 5.1.2 Core Components Table

| Component Name | Primary Responsibility | Key Dependencies | Integration Points | Critical Considerations |
|----------------|------------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| API Gateway | Request routing, authentication, rate limiting | Auth Service | All client applications | Single point of failure, requires high availability |
| Authentication Service | User identity, access control, session management | User database, token store | External identity providers, all services | Security-critical, must be highly reliable |
| Task Management Service | Task CRUD, state management, assignment | Project Service, User Service | Calendar systems | Core business logic, needs strong consistency |
| Project Management Service | Project organization, team management | User Service | Task Service | Hierarchical data model, complex permissions |
| Notification Service | Alert delivery, notification preferences | Task Service, Project Service | Email providers, push services | Eventual consistency, retry mechanisms |
| File Management Service | File storage, attachment handling, versioning | Task Service | Cloud storage providers | Large data volumes, bandwidth considerations |
| Analytics Service | Reporting, dashboards, metrics calculation | Task Service, Project Service | Data warehouse | Complex queries, potential performance impact |
| Real-time Collaboration Service | Live updates, presence tracking | Task Service, Project Service | WebSocket gateway | Connection management, state synchronization |

#### 5.1.3 Data Flow Description

The Task Management System's data flows follow consistent patterns across its components. User interactions begin at the web application, which sends authenticated requests to the API Gateway. The gateway validates tokens, routes requests to appropriate services, and returns responses to the client.

For core task operations, the Task Management Service receives create/update/delete requests, validates them against business rules, and persists changes to its database. Upon successful persistence, it publishes events to a message bus notifying other services of the change. The Notification Service consumes these events to determine if any alerts should be generated, while the Real-time Collaboration Service broadcasts updates to connected clients.

File attachments follow a direct upload pattern where the client requests a pre-signed URL from the File Management Service, then uploads directly to the storage provider. The service then creates a metadata record linking the file to the appropriate task or project.

Data aggregation for reporting flows from the operational databases to a dedicated analytics store optimized for read-heavy workloads. The Analytics Service queries this store to generate reports and dashboard metrics without impacting operational performance.

Cache invalidation occurs through event subscription, where services maintaining caches listen for relevant data change events and update or invalidate their cached data accordingly.

#### 5.1.4 External Integration Points

| System Name | Integration Type | Data Exchange Pattern | Protocol/Format | SLA Requirements |
|-------------|------------------|------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Email Service (SendGrid) | Notification delivery | Asynchronous push | REST API / JSON | 99.5% delivery rate, 5-minute max delay |
| Calendar Systems (Google/Outlook) | Task synchronization | Bi-directional sync | OAuth 2.0 / REST / iCal | 99% sync success, 15-minute sync frequency |
| Cloud Storage (AWS S3) | File storage | Direct upload with signed URLs | HTTPS / Binary | 99.9% availability, 3-second max upload initiation |
| External Authentication (Auth0) | Identity verification | Delegated authentication | OAuth 2.0 / OIDC | 99.99% availability, 300ms response time |

### 5.3 TECHNICAL DECISIONS

#### 5.3.1 Architecture Style Decisions

| Decision | Options | Selected Approach | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| Overall Architecture | Monolith vs. Microservices | Microservices | Allows independent scaling of components, team autonomy, and technology flexibility |
| Communication Pattern | Synchronous vs. Asynchronous | Hybrid | Synchronous for user-facing operations, asynchronous for background processing and notifications |
| API Style | REST vs. GraphQL | REST with specific GraphQL endpoints | REST for broad compatibility, GraphQL for complex data requirements in the dashboard |
| Frontend Architecture | MPA vs. SPA | SPA with React | Provides responsive user experience with minimal page refreshes |

The adoption of microservices architecture is driven by the need to scale different components independently. For example, the Notification Service may require different scaling characteristics than the Task Management Service. This approach also enables resilience through service isolation, where failures in one component won't cascade to others.

The hybrid communication pattern optimizes for different use cases. User actions like task creation use synchronous REST calls for immediate feedback, while notifications and analytics updates use asynchronous event-based communication to decouple services and improve resilience.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Architecture Decision: Communication Pattern] --> B{Real-time Requirements?}
    B -->|Yes| C{Write or Read Operation?}
    B -->|No| D[REST API]
    C -->|Write| E[REST API + Event Publication]
    C -->|Read| F{Complex Data Requirements?}
    F -->|Yes| G[GraphQL Endpoint]
    F -->|No| H[WebSocket for Updates]
```

#### 5.3.2 Data Storage Solution Rationale

| Data Type | Options | Selected Approach | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| User Data | RDBMS vs. NoSQL | MongoDB | Flexible schema for user preferences and profile data, good query performance |
| Task & Project Data | RDBMS vs. NoSQL | PostgreSQL | Complex relationships, transaction support for critical business data |
| File Metadata | RDBMS vs. NoSQL | MongoDB | Schemaless for diverse file attributes, integrated with file storage service |
| Analytics Data | OLTP vs. OLAP | Dedicated OLAP Store | Optimized for analytical queries without impacting operational databases |

The decision to use PostgreSQL for core business data provides strong consistency guarantees and robust transaction support for critical operations like task assignments and status updates. MongoDB offers flexibility for user data, which may have varying attributes based on role or preferences.

Redis is employed as a caching layer and for real-time features requiring high performance, including:
- Session data for quick authentication
- Frequently accessed task lists
- Real-time collaboration presence data
- Notification delivery status

```mermaid

    B -->|Binary Files| F[S3 Object Storage]
    
    C --> G[Tasks, Projects, Workflows]
    D --> H[User Profiles, Comments, Activity]
    E --> I[Caching, Real-time Features]
    F --> J[File Attachments]
```

#### 5.3.3 Caching Strategy Justification

| Cache Type | Implementation | Purpose | Invalidation Strategy |
|------------|----------------|---------|------------------------|
| API Response Cache | Redis | Reduce database load for repeated queries | Time-based expiration + explicit invalidation on writes |
| User Session Cache | Redis | Fast authentication verification | Token-based with JWT expiration |
| Task List Cache | Redis | Accelerate dashboard loading | Event-based invalidation when tasks change |
| User Presence Cache | Redis | Track online users for collaboration | Heartbeat-based with TTL |

The caching strategy uses Redis as a central cache store, with different caching patterns for different data types. API response caching significantly reduces database load for common read operations, while maintaining data integrity through a combination of time-based expiration and explicit invalidation when data changes.

For real-time collaboration, the caching strategy prioritizes consistency by using event-driven invalidation. When a task is updated, an event is published that triggers cache invalidation across all affected services.

```mermaid

        API->>Service: Forward request
        Service->>DB: Query database
        DB->>Service: Return data
        Service->>Cache: Update cache with TTL
        Service->>API: Return data
        API->>Client: Return response
    end
    
    Client->>API: PATCH /tasks/123
    API->>Service: Update task
    Service->>DB: Persist changes
    Service->>Cache: Invalidate related caches
    Service->>API: Confirm update
    API->>Client: Return success
```

### 5.4 CROSS-CUTTING CONCERNS

#### 5.4.1 Monitoring and Observability Approach

The system implements a comprehensive monitoring strategy with multiple layers:

- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: CPU, memory, disk usage, and network metrics for all services
- **Application Metrics**: Request rates, response times, error rates, and business KPIs
- **User Experience Monitoring**: Page load times, client-side errors, and user journey tracking
- **Dependency Monitoring**: Database performance, cache hit rates, and external API availability

Metrics are collected using Prometheus and visualized through Grafana dashboards. Each service exposes a `/metrics` endpoint with standardized operational metrics including:

- Request count and latency by endpoint
- Error count by type and endpoint
- Business metrics (tasks created, completed, etc.)
- Resource utilization

Distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry provides end-to-end visibility of requests flowing through the system. Each request receives a correlation ID that is propagated across service boundaries, allowing for tracing the complete request lifecycle.

Alerting is configured with escalation paths based on severity:
- P1 (Critical): Immediate notification via PagerDuty for production outages
- P2 (High): Email and chat alerts for degraded service
- P3 (Medium): Ticket creation for non-urgent issues
- P4 (Low): Logged for regular review

#### 5.4.2 Logging and Tracing Strategy

| Log Category | Purpose | Retention Period | Storage Location |
|--------------|---------|------------------|------------------|
| Application Logs | Debugging, audit trail | 30 days | Elasticsearch |
| Access Logs | Security monitoring, usage patterns | 90 days | Elasticsearch |
| Audit Logs | Compliance, security investigation | 1 year | Secure storage |
| Error Logs | Issue resolution | 60 days | Elasticsearch |

The logging strategy follows structured logging principles, with each log entry containing:
- Timestamp in ISO 8601 format
- Service name and instance ID
- Log level (INFO, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG)
- Correlation ID for request tracing
- Operation context (user ID, organization ID)
- Structured message payload in JSON format

Sensitive data is redacted from logs according to data protection requirements. PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is either omitted or replaced with tokenized values before storage.

Log aggregation uses Fluentd to collect logs from all services, with Elasticsearch for storage and Kibana for visualization and analysis. Custom dashboards provide visibility into system health and user activity patterns.

#### 5.4.3 Error Handling Patterns

The system implements a consistent approach to error handling across all services:

- **Boundary Controller Pattern**: All external inputs are validated at service boundaries
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevents cascading failures when dependent services fail
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Provides degraded functionality when primary capabilities are unavailable
- **Retry with Exponential Backoff**: For transient failures in service-to-service communication
- **Dead Letter Queues**: For failed asynchronous processing requiring manual intervention

    H7 -->|Reached| H8[Open Circuit]
    H7 -->|Not Reached| H9[Return Error]
    H8 --> H2
    H2 & H5 & H9 --> Z
```

#### 5.4.4 Authentication and Authorization Framework

The system uses a comprehensive security framework with the following components:

- **Authentication**: JWT-based token authentication with refresh token rotation
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Optional for sensitive operations and admin accounts
- **Authorization**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, and OWASP security controls

Authorization is implemented at multiple levels:
1. **Route-level**: Basic access control at API Gateway
2. **Service-level**: Role verification within each service
3. **Resource-level**: Object-level permissions for specific tasks, projects, and files
4. **Field-level**: Attribute-based restrictions on sensitive data fields

The permission model follows a hierarchical structure:
- **System Roles**: Admin, Manager, User
- **Organization Roles**: Owner, Admin, Member
- **Project Roles**: Project Admin, Project Manager, Contributor, Viewer
- **Custom Roles**: User-defined with customizable permission sets

All authentication and authorization decisions are logged for audit purposes, with sensitive operations requiring additional verification steps.

#### 5.4.5 Performance Requirements and SLAs

| Metric | Target | Critical Threshold | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| API Response Time | 95% < 200ms | 99% < 1000ms | Request timing at API Gateway |
| Page Load Time | 90% < 2s | 95% < 5s | Client-side navigation timing |
| Database Query Time | 99% < 100ms | 100% < 500ms | Database query logs |
| Authentication Time | 99% < 300ms | 100% < 1s | Auth service metrics |
| Availability | 99.9% uptime | < 99.5% uptime | Synthetic monitoring |

The system is designed to handle the following load profiles:
- **Peak concurrent users**: 10,000
- **Average requests per second**: 500
- **Peak requests per second**: 2,000
- **Data storage growth**: 100GB per month

Horizontal scaling capabilities allow for elastic expansion during peak usage periods, with auto-scaling configured based on CPU utilization, request queue depth, and response time metrics.

#### 5.4.6 Disaster Recovery Procedures

The system implements a multi-tier disaster recovery strategy:

- **Data Backup**: Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery
- **Infrastructure**: Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform) for rapid reconstruction
- **Geographic Redundancy**: Multi-region deployment for critical services
- **Recovery Automation**: Scripted recovery procedures for common failure scenarios

Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO):
- **Tier 1 (Critical)**: RTO 1 hour, RPO 5 minutes
- **Tier 2 (Important)**: RTO 4 hours, RPO 1 hour
- **Tier 3 (Non-critical)**: RTO 24 hours, RPO 24 hours

Regular disaster recovery testing is scheduled quarterly, with scenarios including:
- Database corruption recovery
- Region failure failover
- Simulated data center outage
- Malicious activity containment

Documentation and runbooks detail step-by-step recovery procedures for each scenario, with assigned responsibilities and communication protocols.

## 6. SYSTEM COMPONENTS DESIGN

### 6.1 USER INTERFACE COMPONENTS

#### 6.1.1 Component Overview

The user interface layer comprises a set of React components organized in a hierarchical structure to provide intuitive task and project management capabilities. The UI follows atomic design principles with components categorized into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages.

| Component Category | Description | Examples |
|-------------------|-------------|----------|
| Atoms | Basic building blocks | Buttons, Input fields, Icons, Labels |
| Molecules | Simple component combinations | Form fields, Task cards, Search bars |
| Organisms | Complex functional units | Task lists, Project cards, Navigation menus |
| Templates | Page layouts without content | Dashboard layout, Project view layout |
| Pages | Complete screens with content | Task board, Project details, Reports |

#### 6.1.2 Key UI Components

| Component | Purpose | Properties | States | Events |
|-----------|---------|------------|--------|--------|
| TaskCard | Display individual task details | task, isAssigned, isOverdue, priority | normal, hover, selected, dragging | onClick, onAssign, onStatusChange |
| TaskBoard | Kanban-style view of tasks | tasks, columns, filters | loading, loaded, error | onTaskMove, onFilterChange |
| ProjectSelector | Navigation between projects | projects, currentProject | collapsed, expanded | onProjectSelect |
| DatePicker | Select task due dates | initialDate, minDate, maxDate | open, closed, selecting | onDateSelect, onClear |
| UserAvatar | Display user profile images | user, size, showStatus | online, offline, away | onClick |

#### 6.1.3 Responsive Design Approach

The UI implements a mobile-first responsive design strategy with the following breakpoints:

- **Small**: < 640px (Mobile phones)
- **Medium**: 641px - 1024px (Tablets and small laptops)
- **Large**: 1025px - 1440px (Desktops and laptops)
- **Extra Large**: > 1440px (Large monitors)

```css
/* Example TailwindCSS configuration */
const breakpoints = {
  sm: '640px',
  md: '1024px',
  lg: '1440px',
  xl: '1920px'
}
```

Responsive layout techniques include:
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for fluid layouts
- Container queries for component-level responsiveness
- Strategic component hiding/showing based on screen size
- Touch-friendly targets (minimum 44px) on mobile devices
- Collapsible navigation on smaller screens

#### 6.1.4 State Management Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    UI[UI Components] <--> RM[React-Query/Redux]
    RM <--> AP[API Layer]
    RM <--> WS[WebSocket Connection]
    
    subgraph "Client State"
        LS[Local Component State]
        RLS[Redux Local State]
        CS[Cache State]
    end
    
    subgraph "Server State"
        RS[Remote Data State]
        SS[Synchronization State]
    end
    
    UI <--> LS
    RM <--> RLS
    RM <--> CS
    AP <--> RS
    WS <--> SS
```

The state management architecture follows a hybrid approach:
- **Redux Toolkit**: For global UI state (current user, app settings, UI mode)
- **React Query**: For server state management (tasks, projects, comments)
- **React Context**: For theme management and feature flags
- **Local Component State**: For component-specific UI states

This separation creates clear boundaries between UI state and server data, improving maintainability and performance by leveraging appropriate caching and invalidation strategies.

#### 6.1.5 Accessibility Considerations

| Requirement | Implementation Approach |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| Keyboard Navigation | Focus management, keyboard shortcuts, logical tab order |
| Screen Reader Support | ARIA labels, semantic HTML, announced updates |
| Color Contrast | WCAG AA compliance (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text) |
| Text Sizing | Relative units (rem/em) for all text elements |
| Reduced Motion | Respects prefers-reduced-motion media query |

All UI components implement the following accessibility features:
- Proper HTML semantics with ARIA roles where needed
- Keyboard focus management with visible focus indicators
- Color-independent status indicators (icons + colors)
- Error states and form validation accessible to screen readers
- Touch targets minimum 44px × 44px on mobile devices

### 6.2 AUTHENTICATION COMPONENT

#### 6.2.1 Component Overview

The Authentication component handles user identity verification, session management, and access control across the system. It provides a secure, standardized mechanism for user authentication while supporting multiple authentication methods.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- User registration and profile management
- Password-based authentication
- OAuth integration with external identity providers
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Session management and token handling
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

#### 6.2.2 Authentication Flow

    alt MFA Required
        AuthService->>Frontend: Request MFA code
        Frontend->>User: Prompt for MFA code
        User->>Frontend: Submit MFA code
        Frontend->>AuthService: POST /auth/mfa/verify
        AuthService->>AuthService: Validate MFA code
    end
    
    AuthService->>TokenService: Generate token pair
    TokenService->>AuthService: Return access & refresh tokens
    AuthService->>Frontend: Return authentication response
    Frontend->>Frontend: Store tokens
    Frontend->>User: Redirect to dashboard
```

#### 6.2.3 Data Models

**User Model**:
```json
{
  "id": "string (UUID)",
  "email": "string (email format)",
  "password": "string (hashed, never exposed)",
  "firstName": "string",
  "lastName": "string",
  "roles": ["string (role identifiers)"],
  "organizations": [
    {
      "id": "string (org UUID)",
      "role": "string (org-specific role)"
    }
  ],
  "settings": {
    "language": "string (ISO code)",
    "theme": "string (theme name)",
    "notifications": {
      "email": "boolean",
      "push": "boolean",

}
```

**Token Model**:
```json
{
  "access": {
    "token": "string (JWT)",
    "expiresAt": "ISO date string"
  },
  "refresh": {
    "token": "string (JWT)",
    "expiresAt": "ISO date string"
  }
}
```

#### 6.2.4 API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Request Body | Response |
|----------|--------|---------|-------------|----------|
| /auth/register | POST | Create new user account | User registration data | User profile, tokens |
| /auth/login | POST | Authenticate user | Email, password | Tokens or MFA challenge |
| /auth/mfa/verify | POST | Verify MFA code | MFA code | Authentication tokens |
| /auth/token/refresh | POST | Get new access token | Refresh token | New token pair |
| /auth/logout | POST | Invalidate tokens | - | Success confirmation |
| /auth/password/reset | POST | Initiate password reset | Email | Reset instructions |
| /auth/password/change | POST | Change password | Old & new passwords | Success confirmation |

#### 6.2.5 Security Measures

| Security Feature | Implementation |
|------------------|----------------|
| Password Storage | bcrypt hashing with per-user salt |
| Token Security | Short-lived JWTs (15min) with longer refresh tokens (7 days) |
| MFA Options | Time-based OTP, SMS verification, email verification |
| Brute Force Protection | Progressive delays, account lockout after multiple failures |
| Session Management | Server-side token blacklisting for immediate invalidation |

#### 6.2.6 RBAC Implementation

```mermaid
classDiagram
    User "1" -- "n" Role
    Role "1" -- "n" Permission
    Resource "1" -- "n" Permission
    
    class User {
        +UUID id
        +String email
        +Array roles
    }
    
    class Role {
        +String name
        +String description
        +Array permissions
    }
    
    class Permission {
        +String resource
        +String action
        +Array conditions
    }
    
    class Resource {
        +String type
        +String identifier
    }
```

The RBAC model defines three standard roles with progressive permission levels:
- **Admin**: Full system access (all resources and actions)
- **Manager**: Project and team management capabilities
- **User**: Basic task creation and management

Custom roles can be defined with specific permission sets tailored to organizational needs.

### 6.3 TASK MANAGEMENT COMPONENT

#### 6.3.1 Component Overview

The Task Management component forms the core functionality of the system, enabling users to create, organize, assign, and track tasks throughout their lifecycle. It supports complex task relationships, prioritization, and progress tracking.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Task creation, updating, and deletion
- Status tracking and workflow transitions
- Task assignment and reassignment
- Priority and due date management
- Task filtering, sorting, and searching
- Task relationship management (subtasks, dependencies)

#### 6.3.2 Task Data Model

#### 6.8.5 API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Parameters/Body | Response |
|----------|--------|---------|----------------|----------|
| /realtime/connect | WebSocket | Establish connection | Auth token | Connection established |
| /realtime/status | GET | Check service status | - | Service health information |
| /realtime/presence | GET | Get online users | Context parameter | List of present users |
| /realtime/channels | GET | List available channels | - | Channel list with metadata |
| /realtime/broadcast | POST | Send message to channel | Channel, message | Delivery confirmation |

#### 6.8.6 Collaborative Editing Implementation

The system implements Operational Transformation (OT) for collaborative text editing, ensuring consistent document state across multiple concurrent editors:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User1
    participant User2
    participant Client1
    participant Client2
    participant Server
    
    User1->>Client1: Edit text
    Client1->>Client1: Generate operation
    Client1->>Server: Send operation
    Server->>Server: Transform operation
    Server->>Client1: Acknowledge
    Server->>Client2: Send transformed operation
    Client2->>Client2: Apply operation
    Client2->>User2: Update view
    
    User2->>Client2: Edit text
    Client2->>Client2: Generate operation
    Client2->>Server: Send operation
    Server->>Server: Transform operation
    Server->>Client2: Acknowledge
    Server->>Client1: Send transformed operation
    Client1->>Client1: Apply operation
    Client1->>User1: Update view
```

**Conflict Resolution Strategy**:
- Document divided into atomic sections for parallel editing
- Pessimistic locking for structured fields (status, assignee)
- Optimistic locking with version vectors for text content
- Last-writer-wins for simple scalar values
- Automatic merge for non-conflicting changes
- Conflict resolution UI for unresolvable conflicts

#### 6.8.7 Scalability Considerations

The real-time component implements several strategies for scalability:

1. **Connection Partitioning**: Users distributed across server instances
2. **Channel-based Routing**: Events routed only to relevant subscribers
3. **Message Throttling**: Rate limiting for high-frequency updates
4. **Selective Broadcasting**: Content filtering to minimize payload size
5. **Heartbeat Optimization**: Adaptive ping intervals based on activity
6. **Connection Draining**: Graceful migration during deployments

### 6.1 CORE SERVICES ARCHITECTURE

#### 6.1.1 SERVICE COMPONENTS

The Task Management System is designed with a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, resilience, and maintainability. Each service is responsible for a specific domain of functionality with clear boundaries.

##### Service Boundaries and Responsibilities

| Service | Primary Responsibilities | Data Domains |
|---------|--------------------------|-------------|
| Authentication Service | User authentication, authorization, role management | Users, roles, permissions |
| Task Service | Task CRUD operations, status management, assignment | Tasks, subtasks, task history |
| Project Service | Project organization, team management, categorization | Projects, team memberships, categories |
| Notification Service | Alert generation, delivery across channels, preferences | Notifications, delivery status, preferences |
| File Service | File uploads, storage, retrieval, versioning | File metadata, content, versions |
| Analytics Service | Reporting, metrics calculation, dashboard data | Report templates, aggregated metrics |
| Real-time Service | WebSocket connections, event broadcasting, presence | Connection state, events, presence data |

##### Inter-service Communication Patterns

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Client[Client Applications] <--> API[API Gateway]
    
    API <--> Auth[Authentication Service]
    API <--> Task[Task Service]
    API <--> Project[Project Service]
    API <--> Notification[Notification Service]
    API <--> File[File Service]
    API <--> Analytics[Analytics Service]
    API <--> RealTime[Real-time Service]
    
    Task <--> EventBus[Event Bus]
    Project <--> EventBus
    Auth <--> EventBus
    Notification <--> EventBus
    File <--> EventBus
    Analytics <--> EventBus
    RealTime <--> EventBus
    
    Task -- "REST" --> Project
    Task -- "REST" --> Auth
    Project -- "REST" --> Auth
    File -- "REST" --> Task
    File -- "REST" --> Project
    Analytics -- "REST" --> Task
    Analytics -- "REST" --> Project
```

The system uses a hybrid communication approach:
- **Synchronous Communication**: REST APIs for direct service-to-service requests where immediate responses are required
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Event-driven architecture via a message bus for notifications and state changes
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSockets for client updates and collaborative features

| Communication Type | Implementation | Use Cases |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------|
| Synchronous REST | HTTP/JSON with standardized error responses | User authentication, task creation/updates |
| Asynchronous Events | RabbitMQ with event schemas | Status changes, notifications, analytics updates |
| Real-time | WebSocket connections with subscription model | Live updates, collaborative editing, presence |

##### Service Discovery and Load Balancing

| Component | Implementation | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Service Registry | Consul | Maintains service inventory and health status |
| API Gateway | Kong | Routes client requests to appropriate services |
| Load Balancer | Nginx with round-robin algorithm | Distributes traffic across service instances |
| Health Checks | Active and passive monitoring | Detects unhealthy service instances |

The service discovery process follows these steps:
1. Services register with Consul on startup with metadata
2. Consul performs regular health checks to verify service availability
3. API Gateway queries Consul for service locations
4. Load balancer distributes requests based on health status and load

##### Circuit Breaker and Resiliency Patterns

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Closed
    Closed --> Open: Error threshold exceeded
    Open --> HalfOpen: After timeout period
    HalfOpen --> Closed: Successful test requests
    HalfOpen --> Open: Continued failures
```

| Pattern | Implementation | Configuration |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| Circuit Breaker | Resilience4j | 50% error rate threshold, 30-second open state |
| Rate Limiting | Kong plugins | Tiered limits (60/min standard, 300/min for API clients) |
| Bulkhead | Thread isolation | Separate thread pools for critical vs. non-critical operations |
| Retry | Exponential backoff | Max 3 retries with jitter for idempotent operations |
| Fallback | Graceful degradation | Cache responses, simplified alternatives for critical flows |

#### 6.1.2 SCALABILITY DESIGN

##### Scaling Approach by Service

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Scaling Strategy"
        direction TB
        HScaling[Horizontal Scaling] --> StatelessServices[Stateless Services]
        StatelessServices --> Auth[Authentication]
        StatelessServices --> Task[Task Management]
        StatelessServices --> Project[Project Management]

        ComputeIntensive --> ReportGeneration[Report Generation]
        
        HybridScaling[Hybrid Scaling] --> RealTimeServices[Real-time Services]
    end
```

| Service | Scaling Approach | Rationale | Key Metrics |
|---------|------------------|-----------|------------|
| Authentication | Horizontal | High request volume, stateless operations | Requests/sec, latency |
| Task/Project | Horizontal | Core business logic, predictable resource needs | Transaction volume, request latency |
| Real-time | Hybrid | Connection-oriented, needs sticky sessions | Active connections, message throughput |
| Analytics | Horizontal with sharding | Data-intensive, can be partitioned by tenant | Query complexity, data volume |
| File Service | Horizontal | I/O intensive, bandwidth constrained | Upload/download throughput |

##### Auto-scaling Configuration

| Service | Scaling Trigger | Scale-out Rule | Scale-in Rule | Cool-down Period |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| Authentication | CPU utilization | >70% for 3 minutes | <30% for 10 minutes | 5 minutes |
| Task/Project | Request queue depth | >100 requests | <20 requests for 15 minutes | 5 minutes |
| Real-time | Connection count | >5000 per instance | <2000 per instance for 15 minutes | 10 minutes |
| Analytics | Memory utilization | >75% for 5 minutes | <40% for 20 minutes | 15 minutes |
| File Service | Network throughput | >800 Mbps | <300 Mbps for 15 minutes | 10 minutes |

The system uses predictive scaling for anticipated usage patterns:
- Business hours (9am-5pm) maintain higher minimum instance counts
- End of month/quarter increases analytics capacity proactively
- Scheduled scale-ups before planned large team onboarding

##### Performance Optimization Techniques

| Technique | Implementation | Benefit |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Caching | Redis for API responses (5-min TTL) | Reduces database load, improves response times |
| Connection Pooling | HikariCP for database connections | Reduces connection overhead, improves throughput |
| Asynchronous Processing | Task offloading for non-critical operations | Improves perceived performance, handles spikes |
| Data Partitioning | Tenant-based sharding | Improves query performance, enables selective scaling |
| Read Replicas | For frequently accessed data | Distributes query load, improves read performance |

##### Capacity Planning Guidelines

Capacity planning follows these principles:
- N+2 redundancy for critical services (maintain capacity with two node failures)
- 40% headroom maintained during normal operations
- Benchmark-based resource allocation (CPU, memory, network)
- Regular load testing to validate scaling policies
- Growth forecasting based on user acquisition trends

#### 6.1.3 RESILIENCE PATTERNS

##### Fault Tolerance Mechanisms

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Request[Client Request] --> Gateway[API Gateway]
    Gateway --> Service[Service Instance]
    
    Service -- Success --> ResponseSuccess[Successful Response]
    Service -- Failure --> CircuitBreaker{Circuit Breaker}
    
    CircuitBreaker -- Open --> Fallback[Fallback Mechanism]
    CircuitBreaker -- Closed --> Retry[Retry with Backoff]
    
    Retry -- Success --> ResponseSuccess
    Retry -- Continued Failure --> Fallback

    Fallback --> CachedResponse[Cached Response]
    Fallback --> PartialData[Partial Data Response]
    
    ResponseSuccess & DegradedResponse & CachedResponse & PartialData --> ClientResponse[Response to Client]
```

| Failure Type | Detection Mechanism | Response Strategy |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Service Instance Failure | Health checks | Route to healthy instances |
| Database Degradation | Query timeouts | Read from replicas, write queue |
| Third-party Service Outage | Circuit breaker | Use cached data, simplified alternatives |
| Network Partition | Heartbeat monitoring | Regional failover, eventual consistency |

##### Disaster Recovery Procedures

| Scenario | Recovery Procedure | RTO | RPO |
|----------|-------------------|-----|-----|
| Service Failure | Auto-scaling replacement | <5 min | 0 min |
| Zone Outage | Multi-zone failover | <15 min | <1 min |
| Region Failure | Cross-region activation | <30 min | <5 min |
| Database Corruption | Point-in-time recovery | <60 min | <15 min |
| Catastrophic Failure | Full system rebuild from backups | <4 hours | <30 min |

The system implements a tiered disaster recovery strategy:
1. **Automated Recovery**: For single component failures (auto-scaling, self-healing)
2. **Operator-Assisted Recovery**: For complex failures requiring verification (guided procedures)
3. **Full DR Activation**: For region-level failures (runbook-driven process)

Regular DR testing occurs quarterly with scenario-based simulations and measured recovery metrics.

##### Data Redundancy Approach

    Primary --> Async1[Asynchronous Replica 1]
    Primary --> Async2[Asynchronous Replica 2]

    Primary --> PointInTime[Point-in-Time Backups]
    PointInTime --> S3[S3 Storage]
    S3 --> CrossRegion[Cross-Region Replication]
```

| Data Type | Redundancy Approach | Recovery Method |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Transactional Data | Multi-AZ synchronous replication | Automatic failover |
| Analytical Data | Cross-region asynchronous replication | Manual promotion |
| File Attachments | Multi-region S3 with versioning | Object restoration |
| Configuration | Git-versioned, environment-specific | Infrastructure as Code deployment |

##### Service Degradation Policies

When facing resource constraints or partial outages, the system implements a graceful degradation strategy:

| Degradation Level | Triggered By | Features Affected | User Experience |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Level 1 (Minor) | Elevated error rates (>5%) | Real-time updates delayed | Slight collaboration lag |
| Level 2 (Moderate) | Significant service latency | Analytics, reporting limited | Core functionality intact, advanced features limited |
| Level 3 (Severe) | Critical service unavailable | File uploads, complex queries | Read-only mode for affected components |
| Level 4 (Critical) | Multiple service failures | Non-essential services disabled | Focus on data integrity and basic operations |

Each degradation level has predefined configuration changes, communication templates, and restoration procedures to maintain system stability while maximizing available functionality.

Degradation decisions follow these principles:
1. Preserve data integrity above all else
2. Maintain core task operations when possible
3. Degrade non-essential features first
4. Communicate status clearly to users
5. Recover methodically with validation at each step

## 6.2 DATABASE DESIGN

### 6.2.1 SCHEMA DESIGN

#### Entity Relationships

The Task Management System implements a hybrid database approach, using MongoDB as the primary database for its flexible schema design and Redis for caching and real-time features.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USERS ||--o{ TASKS : creates
    USERS ||--o{ TASKS : "assigned to"
    USERS ||--o{ PROJECTS : creates
    USERS }|--o{ PROJECTS : "member of"
    PROJECTS ||--o{ TASKS : contains
    TASKS ||--o{ COMMENTS : has
    USERS ||--o{ COMMENTS : creates

    USERS ||--o{ ATTACHMENTS : uploads
    TASKS ||--o{ SUBTASKS : contains
    TASKS ||--|| TASK_HISTORY : tracks
    USERS ||--o{ NOTIFICATIONS : receives
    TASKS }|--o{ TAGS : categorized
```

#### Core Data Models

    "updatedAt": "Date",
    "completedAt": "Date",
    "timeEstimate": "number (minutes)",
    "timeSpent": "number (minutes)"
  }
}
```

#### Indexing Strategy

| Collection | Index | Type | Purpose |
|------------|-------|------|---------|
| users | email_1 | Unique | Fast user lookup by email |
| users | organizations.orgId_1 | Standard | Organization membership queries |
| tasks | assigneeId_1_status_1 | Compound | Task list by assignee and status |
| tasks | projectId_1_status_1 | Compound | Project task lists by status |
| tasks | dueDate_1 | Standard | Due date sorting and filtering |
| tasks | createdBy_1 | Standard | Tasks created by user |

Additional indexes include:
- Full-text search indexes on task title and description
- Geospatial indexes for location-based features (optional)
- TTL (Time-To-Live) indexes for temporary data and notifications

#### Partitioning Strategy

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    DB[MongoDB Cluster] --> S1[Primary Shard]
    DB --> S2[Organization Shard 1-100]
    DB --> S3[Organization Shard 101-200]
    DB --> S4[Archive Shard]
    
    S1 --> C1[System Collections]
    S1 --> C2[Shared Reference Data]
    
    S2 --> O1[Org 1 Data]
    S2 --> O2[Org 2 Data]
    S2 --> O100[Org 100 Data]
    
    S3 --> O101[Org 101 Data]
    S3 --> O102[Org 102 Data]
    S3 --> O200[Org 200 Data]
    
    S4 --> A1[Archived Tasks]
    S4 --> A2[Archived Projects]
    S4 --> A3[Audit Logs]
```

| Partition Type | Implementation | Benefits |
|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Organization/Tenant | Hash-based sharding on orgId | Isolates tenant data, improves query performance |
| Time-based | Date range partitioning on completion date | Efficiently manages archived/historical data |
| Activity Logs | Separate collections by month | Optimizes storage and query performance for logs |

#### Replication Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Client[Application] --> LB[Load Balancer]
    
    LB -->|Writes| P[Primary Node]
    LB -->|Reads| S1[Secondary Node 1]
    LB -->|Reads| S2[Secondary Node 2]
    LB -->|Analytics| A[Analytics Node]
    
    P -->|Sync| S1
    P -->|Sync| S2
    P -->|Async| A
    
    P --> CL[Change Log]
    
    CL -->|Backup| BC[Backup Coordinator]
    BC -->|Daily| DS[Daily Snapshots]
    BC -->|Hourly| OL[Oplog Backups]
    
    DS --> S3[S3 Storage]
    OL --> S3
```

The system uses a replica set configuration with:
- One primary node handling all write operations
- Multiple secondary nodes for read scaling
- Dedicated analytics node with delayed replication for reporting workloads
- Cross-region replica for disaster recovery (in production)

#### Backup Architecture

| Backup Type | Frequency | Retention | Storage |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Full Database Snapshot | Daily | 30 days | S3 with cross-region replication |
| Incremental Backup (oplog) | Hourly | 7 days | S3 with cross-region replication |
| Logical Backup (JSON export) | Weekly | 90 days | S3 with encryption-at-rest |
| Point-in-Time Recovery | Continuous | 7 days | Write-ahead logs |

### 6.2.2 DATA MANAGEMENT

#### Migration Procedures

The database migration strategy follows these principles:

1. **Schema Versioning**: Each database schema version corresponds to application versions
2. **Automated Scripts**: Migrations are handled by versioned scripts 
3. **Backward Compatibility**: New schema changes maintain compatibility with older versions
4. **Rollback Capability**: Each migration has a corresponding rollback script
5. **Testing**: Migrations are tested against production-like data volumes

Sample migration process:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant Build as CI/CD Pipeline
    participant Test as Test Environment
    participant Stage as Staging
    participant Prod as Production
    
    Dev->>Build: Submit schema change
    Build->>Build: Generate migration script
    Build->>Test: Apply migration
    Test->>Test: Validate changes
    Test->>Build: Approve migration
    
    Build->>Stage: Deploy with migration
    Stage->>Stage: Verify with real data
    Stage->>Prod: Scheduled deployment
    
    Prod->>Prod: Take snapshot
    Prod->>Prod: Apply migration
    Prod->>Prod: Verify integrity
    
    alt Migration Fails
        Prod->>Prod: Execute rollback
        Prod->>Prod: Restore from snapshot
    end
```

#### Versioning Strategy

| Version Element | Implementation | Purpose |
|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| Schema Version | Stored in dedicated collection | Tracks current schema version |
| Document Versioning | Version field in documents | Enables concurrent modification detection |
| Collection Versioning | Collection naming with version suffixes | Supports major schema changes |

#### Archival Policies

| Data Type | Archive Trigger | Storage Location | Retrieval Mechanism |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Completed Tasks | 90 days after completion | Archive collection | Read-only API with pagination |
| Cancelled Tasks | 30 days after cancellation | Archive collection | Read-only API with pagination |
| Deleted Projects | 30 days after deletion | Archive collection | Admin-only restoration API |
| Audit Logs | 1 year retention | Time-partitioned collection | Compliance reporting interface |

#### Data Storage and Retrieval Mechanisms

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Client[Client App] --> API[API Layer]
    
    API --> Services[Service Layer]
    
    Services --> DataAccess[Data Access Layer]
    
    DataAccess --> Cache[Redis Cache]
    Cache -->|Cache Miss| MongoDB[(MongoDB)]
    
    DataAccess --> MongoDB
    
    MongoDB -->|Large Files| GridFS[GridFS]
    MongoDB -->|Regular Documents| Collections[Collections]
    
    Services --> S3[S3 Storage]
```

The system implements:
- Repository pattern for data access abstraction
- Strategic denormalization for performance-critical operations
- Projection queries to limit returned fields
- GridFS for files exceeding document size limits

#### Caching Policies

| Cache Level | Implementation | Expiration Strategy | Use Cases |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Query Cache | Redis hash sets | TTL: 5 minutes | Frequently accessed task lists |
| Object Cache | Redis JSON | TTL: 15 minutes | User profiles, project details |
| Authentication Cache | Redis hash | TTL: 24 hours | Session data, permissions |
| Aggregate Cache | Redis hash | TTL: 30 minutes | Dashboard metrics, reports |

Cache invalidation occurs through:
- Time-based expiration
- Event-driven invalidation on data changes
- Selective key invalidation for fine-grained control

### 6.2.3 COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS

#### Data Retention Rules

| Data Category | Retention Period | Justification | Implementation |
|---------------|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| User Accounts | 7 years after deletion | Legal/compliance requirement | Soft delete with inactive flag |
| Task History | 3 years | Business operations | Archive collection with time-based expiration |
| Authentication Logs | 1 year | Security compliance | Secure audit collection with TTL index |
| Session Data | 30 days | User experience | Redis with expiration |

#### Backup and Fault Tolerance Policies

| Component | RPO | RTO | Implementation |
|-----------|-----|-----|----------------|
| Core Transactional Data | 15 minutes | 1 hour | Primary-secondary replication with point-in-time recovery |
| User Content | 1 hour | 4 hours | S3 cross-region replication |
| Configuration Data | 24 hours | 2 hours | Configuration-as-code with version control |

The system implements the following disaster recovery mechanisms:
- Automated failover to secondary replicas

| Dashboard Data | Pre-aggregation, materialized views | Periodic aggregation jobs updating summary collections |
| Search | Text indexes, query rewriting | Text index on task title/description with relevance scoring |
| Reporting | Dedicated analytics replicas | Queries routed to secondary nodes optimized for analytics |

#### Caching Strategy

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Request[API Request] --> CacheCheck{Cache Hit?}
    
    CacheCheck -->|Yes| CachedData[Return Cached Data]
    
    CacheCheck -->|No| DBQuery[Query Database]
    DBQuery --> ProcessData[Process Data]
    ProcessData --> StoreCache[Store in Cache]
    StoreCache --> ReturnData[Return Data]
    
    UpdateEvent[Data Update Event] --> InvalidateCache[Invalidate Related Cache]
    InvalidateCache --> RegenCache{Regenerate?}
    RegenCache -->|Yes| DBQuery
    RegenCache -->|No| CacheInvalidated[Mark Cache Invalid]
```

| Cache Type | Storage | TTL | Invalidation Trigger |
|------------|---------|-----|----------------------|
| API Response | Redis | 5 minutes | Related entity updates |
| User Session | Redis | 24 hours sliding | Password change, logout |
| Query Results | Redis | 15 minutes | Data mutations |
| Aggregate Data | Redis | 30 minutes | Scheduled refresh |

#### Connection Pooling

| Parameter | Development | Production | Justification |
|-----------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| Min Pool Size | 5 | 20 | Minimize connection creation overhead |
| Max Pool Size | 10 | 100 | Handle peak load while preventing resource exhaustion |
| Max Idle Time | 30 seconds | 10 minutes | Balance resource usage with connection overhead |
| Connection Timeout | 5 seconds | 3 seconds | Fail fast during connection issues |

#### Read/Write Splitting

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Client[Client Application] --> Router[Query Router]
    
    Router -->|Writes| Primary[(Primary DB)]
    Router -->|User Profile Reads| Primary
    Router -->|Task List Reads| Secondary1[(Secondary DB 1)]
    Router -->|Project Reads| Secondary2[(Secondary DB 2)]
    Router -->|Reporting Queries| Analytics[(Analytics DB)]
    
    Primary -->|Replication| Secondary1
    Primary -->|Replication| Secondary2
    Primary -->|Delayed Replication| Analytics
```

The system implements intelligent read routing:
- Write operations always go to primary
- User authentication/profile reads use primary for consistency
- Task and project reads distributed across secondaries
- Analytics and reporting queries route to dedicated analytics nodes

#### Batch Processing Approach

| Operation Type | Batch Implementation | Optimization |
|----------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Task Updates | Bulk write operations | Ordered:false for parallel processing |
| Notification Processing | Queue-based batching | Message grouping by recipient |
| Report Generation | Aggregation pipeline | Optimized stages with allowDiskUse:true |
| Data Imports | Chunked processing | Parallel processing with progress tracking |

Key batch processing strategies:
- Breaking large operations into smaller chunks
- Background processing for non-interactive operations
- Scheduled maintenance windows for intensive operations
- Progress tracking and resumability for long-running processes

## 6.3 INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

### 6.3.1 API DESIGN

The Task Management System exposes a comprehensive set of APIs to enable integration with external systems and services, ensuring extensibility and interoperability.

#### Protocol Specifications

| Protocol | Purpose | Implementation |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| REST | Primary API for CRUD operations | JSON over HTTPS with standard HTTP methods |
| WebSocket | Real-time updates and collaboration | Secure WebSocket (WSS) with JSON messages |
| GraphQL | Complex data querying for dashboards | Limited endpoint for reporting and analytics |

#### API Authentication Methods

| Method | Use Case | Implementation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| JWT | Standard user authentication | RS256 signed tokens with 1-hour expiry |
| OAuth 2.0 | Third-party integration | Authorization code flow with PKCE |
| API Keys | Service-to-service communication | UUID-based keys with prefix for service identification |

#### Authorization Framework

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Request[API Request] --> AuthN[Authentication]
    AuthN -->|Token/Key Valid| AuthZ[Authorization]
    AuthN -->|Invalid| Reject[401 Unauthorized]
    
    AuthZ --> RoleCheck{Role Check}
    RoleCheck -->|Sufficient Role| ResourceCheck{Resource Check}
    RoleCheck -->|Insufficient| Forbidden[403 Forbidden]
    
    ResourceCheck -->|Has Access| RateLimit[Rate Limiting]
    ResourceCheck -->|No Access| Forbidden
    
    RateLimit -->|Within Limits| Process[Process Request]
    RateLimit -->|Exceeded| TooMany[429 Too Many Requests]
```

The system implements a multi-layered authorization approach:
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Aligns with user roles (Admin, Manager, Member)
- **Resource-Based Authorization**: Verifies access to specific tasks/projects
- **Scope-Based Permissions**: Controls API integration capabilities

#### Rate Limiting Strategy

| Consumer Type | Request Limit | Time Window | Throttling Approach |
|---------------|---------------|------------|---------------------|
| Basic User | 100 requests | Per minute | Gradual backoff with retry-after header |
| Premium User | 1,000 requests | Per minute | Warning at 80%, throttling at 100% |
| Service Account | 10,000 requests | Per hour | Configurable limits with alert notifications |

Rate limits are enforced at the API Gateway level using a token bucket algorithm. Burst allowances permit temporary spikes in traffic.

#### Versioning Approach

The API versioning strategy follows these principles:
- URI-based versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/tasks`)
- Minimum 12-month support for previous versions
- Explicit deprecation notices with migration guides
- Version compatibility headers for fine-grained support

#### API Documentation Standards

| Documentation Type | Format | Purpose |
|--------------------|--------|---------|
| API Specification | OpenAPI 3.0 | Machine-readable API contract |
| Reference Documentation | Markdown/HTML | Developer-focused reference guides |
| Integration Guides | Markdown/HTML | Step-by-step integration tutorials |

    TaskQ --> TaskConsumer[Task Event Consumer]
    ProjectQ --> ProjectConsumer[Project Event Consumer]
    NotificationQ --> NotificationConsumer[Notification Consumer]
    IntegrationQ --> IntegrationConsumer[Integration Consumer]
    
    TaskConsumer & ProjectConsumer & NotificationConsumer & IntegrationConsumer --> DLX[Dead Letter Exchange]
    DLX --> DLQ[Dead Letter Queue]
    DLQ --> ErrorHandler[Error Handler Service]
```

#### Stream Processing Design

Real-time data streams are processed using the following patterns:

- **WebSocket Streams**: Deliver live updates to connected clients
- **Change Data Capture**: Monitor database changes for integration events
- **Activity Streams**: Aggregate user actions for analytics and audit

#### Batch Processing Flows

| Batch Process | Scheduling | Implementation | Error Handling |
|---------------|------------|----------------|---------------|
| Report Generation | Daily/Weekly | Worker processes with checkpointing | Failed jobs resume from checkpoint |
| Bulk Task Import | On-demand | Chunked processing with validation | Partial success with error reporting |
| Analytics Aggregation | Hourly | Incremental processing with idempotency | Full reprocessing fallback |

#### Error Handling Strategy

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Process[Message Processing] --> Success{Successful?}
    Success -->|Yes| Acknowledge[Acknowledge Message]
    Success -->|No| Retriable{Retriable Error?}
    Retriable -->|Yes| RetryCount{Retry < Max?}
    Retriable -->|No| DeadLetter[Move to Dead Letter Queue]
    RetryCount -->|Yes| Backoff[Exponential Backoff]
    RetryCount -->|No| DeadLetter
    Backoff --> Requeue[Requeue Message]
    Requeue --> Process
    DeadLetter --> ErrorNotification[Send Error Notification]
    DeadLetter --> ErrorLog[Log Detailed Error]
    DeadLetter --> ManualReview[Flag for Manual Review]
    Acknowledge --> End[End Process]
```

Key error handling patterns include:
- Retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Circuit breaker pattern for failing downstream services
- Dead letter queues for messages that cannot be processed
- Compensating transactions for maintaining data consistency

    AlertManager -->|Notifications| Channels[Notification Channels]
    Channels --> Email[Email]
    Channels --> Slack[Slack]
    Channels --> PagerDuty[PagerDuty]
```

| Component | Implementation | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Collection | Prometheus with service instrumentation | Gather metrics from all system components |
| Storage | Prometheus TSDB with configurable retention | Store time-series data for analysis |
| Exporters | Custom exporters for service-specific metrics | Translate application metrics to Prometheus format |
| Frontend | OpenTelemetry + Custom JavaScript | Capture client-side performance data |

Each service exposes a `/metrics` endpoint that provides:
- Standard service metrics (request count, latency, error rates)
- JVM/runtime metrics (memory, garbage collection, threads)
- Business metrics (task creation rate, completion rate)
- Custom health indicators

#### Log Aggregation

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Services[Service Containers] -->|Generate logs| FluentBit[Fluent Bit Agents]
    FluentBit -->|Forward| Fluentd[Fluentd Aggregators]
    
    Infra[Infrastructure Components] -->|Generate logs| FluentBit

    Elasticsearch -->|Visualize| Kibana[Kibana Dashboards]
    
    Fluentd -->|Alert on patterns| AlertManager[Alert Manager]
    Fluentd -->|Archive| S3[Log Archive]
```

| Log Type | Retention | Format | Sample Fields |
|----------|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Application | 30 days active, 1 year archived | JSON | timestamp, service, level, message, traceId |
| Access | 90 days | JSON | timestamp, path, method, statusCode, latency |
| Audit | 1 year | JSON | timestamp, user, action, resource, status |
| System | 30 days | JSON | timestamp, host, component, message |

The logging strategy implements:
- Structured logging with consistent JSON format
- Correlation IDs propagated across all services
- Log level adjustment without deployment
- PII redaction before storage

#### Distributed Tracing

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Client[Client] -->|Request with header| Gateway[API Gateway]
    Gateway -->|Propagate traceId| Service1[Service 1]
    Service1 -->|Propagate traceId| Service2[Service 2]
    Service1 -->|Propagate traceId| Service3[Service 3]
    Service2 -->|Propagate traceId| DB[(Database)]
    Service3 -->|Propagate traceId| Queue[(Message Queue)]
    
    Gateway -->|Report spans| Collector[OpenTelemetry Collector]
    Service1 -->|Report spans| Collector
    Service2 -->|Report spans| Collector
    Service3 -->|Report spans| Collector
    
    Collector -->|Export| Jaeger[(Jaeger)]
    Jaeger -->|Visualize| UI[Jaeger UI]
```

| Tracing Feature | Implementation | Benefit |
|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| Context Propagation | W3C Trace Context headers | Consistent tracing across service boundaries |
| Sampling | Adaptive sampling (1% baseline, 100% for errors) | Balance between visibility and performance |
| Span Enrichment | Automatic and manual attributes | Enhanced debugging context |
| Service Maps | Auto-generated from trace data | System topology visualization |

OpenTelemetry instrumentation captures:
- Request paths through the system
- Service dependencies and latencies
- Error propagation chains
- Database and external service calls

#### Alert Management

| Alert Severity | Response Time | Notification Channels | Escalation |
|----------------|---------------|----------------------|------------|
| P1 (Critical) | 15 minutes | PagerDuty, SMS, Phone | Management after 30 minutes |
| P2 (High) | 30 minutes | PagerDuty, Slack | Management after 2 hours |
| P3 (Medium) | 4 hours | Email, Slack | Management after 24 hours |
| P4 (Low) | 24 hours | Email | None - tracked in ticket system |

Alert configuration follows these principles:
- Alert on symptoms, not causes
- Include runbook links in alert descriptions
- Group related alerts to prevent alert storms
- Implement alert suppression during maintenance windows

#### Dashboard Design

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Executive Dashboard"
        SLAs[SLA Compliance]
        SystemHealth[System Health]
        UserMetrics[User Activity]

### 6.5.5 SLA REQUIREMENTS AND MONITORING

| Service Component | Availability Target | Response Time Target | Measurement Method |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| API Gateway | 99.95% | 99% < 100ms | Load balancer metrics |
| Authentication Service | 99.99% | 99% < 300ms | Service instrumentation |
| Task Service | 99.9% | 99% < 500ms | Service instrumentation |
| Project Service | 99.9% | 99% < 500ms | Service instrumentation |
| File Service | 99.9% | 99% < 1000ms | Service instrumentation |
| Notification Service | 99.9% | N/A (async) | Queue processing time |
| Database | 99.99% | 99% < 100ms | Query monitoring |
| Search | 99.9% | 99% < 800ms | Service instrumentation |
| Overall System | 99.9% | 95% < 2000ms | Synthetic transactions |

The system implements a multi-level SLA monitoring approach:
1. **Real User Monitoring**: Actual user experience metrics
2. **Synthetic Monitoring**: Scripted user flows run at regular intervals
3. **Component Monitoring**: Internal service performance
4. **Dependency Monitoring**: External service availability

SLA breaches trigger automatic incident creation and notification to stakeholders based on severity and duration.

## 6.6 TESTING STRATEGY

### 6.6.1 TESTING APPROACH

#### Unit Testing

| Aspect | Backend (Python) | Frontend (TypeScript/React) |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------------|
| Testing Framework | PyTest 7.4.x | Jest 29.x + React Testing Library |
| Test Location | `tests/unit/` directory beside service code | `src/__tests__/unit/` within component directories |
| Mocking Strategy | pytest-mock for function mocking, mongomock for database | jest.mock() for services, MSW for API mocking |
| Code Coverage | Minimum 85% statement coverage | Minimum 80% statement coverage |

**Test Organization Structure:**

```
backend-service/
├── app/
│   └── [service code]
├── tests/
│   ├── unit/
│   │   ├── test_auth.py
│   │   ├── test_tasks.py
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── integration/
│   └── conftest.py
└── pytest.ini

frontend/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── TaskCard/
│   │   │   ├── TaskCard.tsx
│   │   │   └── __tests__/
│   │   │       └── TaskCard.test.tsx
│   │   └── ...
└── jest.config.js
```

**Test Naming Conventions:**

- Backend: `test_[function_name].py` for files, `test_[scenario]_[expected_result]` for test cases
- Frontend: `[ComponentName].test.tsx` for files, `should [expected behavior] when [condition]` for test cases

**Test Data Management:**

- Test fixtures defined in `conftest.py` for backend
- Factory functions for generating test data with sensible defaults
- Static test data stored in JSON files for complex scenarios
- Separation of test data creation from test logic

**Example Unit Test Pattern (Backend):**

```python
def test_create_task_with_valid_data_returns_created_task(client, mock_db, task_payload):
    # Arrange
    mock_db.tasks.insert_one.return_value.inserted_id = "test_id"
    
    # Act
    response = client.post("/api/v1/tasks", json=task_payload)
    
    # Assert
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert "id" in response.json
    assert response.json["title"] == task_payload["title"]
```

**Example Unit Test Pattern (Frontend):**

```typescript
test('should display task details when task is provided', () => {
  // Arrange
  const task = { id: '123', title: 'Test Task', status: 'in-progress' };
  
  // Act
  render(<TaskCard task={task} />);
  
  // Assert
  expect(screen.getByText('Test Task')).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.getByText('In Progress')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

#### Integration Testing

| Aspect | Approach | Tools |
|--------|----------|-------|
| API Testing | Contract-based testing with schema validation | Pact, Postman/Newman, pytest-flask |
| Service Integration | Testing service interactions with test doubles | pytest fixtures, testcontainers |
| Database Integration | Testing with real database instances in containers | testcontainers-python, mongodb test containers |
| External Services | Mocking third-party APIs with recorded responses | WireMock, responses, VCR.py |

**Integration Test Environment Management:**

- Ephemeral test environments using Docker Compose
- Database seeding with known test data
- Environment teardown after each test suite
- Database state reset between test runs

**API Testing Strategy:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    DefineContract[Define API Contract] --> ValidateImpl[Validate Implementation]
    ValidateImpl --> TestHappyPath[Test Happy Paths]
    TestHappyPath --> TestErrorCases[Test Error Cases]
    TestErrorCases --> TestEdgeCases[Test Edge Cases]
    TestEdgeCases --> PerformanceTest[Test Performance Constraints]
    
    ValidateImpl --> ConsumerTests[Run Consumer Tests]
    ConsumerTests --> VerifyContract[Verify Contract Compliance]
```

**Example Integration Test Pattern:**

```python
def test_task_creation_triggers_notification(test_app, db, test_user):
    # Arrange - Create authenticated client and notification spy
    client = authenticate_client(test_app, test_user)
    notification_spy = mocker.patch('app.services.notification_service.send_notification')
    
    # Act - Create a task with an assignee
    task_data = {"title": "Integration Test Task", "assignee_id": "user_123"}
    response = client.post("/api/v1/tasks", json=task_data)
    
    # Assert - Verify task created and notification sent
    assert response.status_code == 201
    task_id = response.json["id"]
    
    # Verify task in database
    db_task = db.tasks.find_one({"_id": task_id})
    assert db_task is not None
    
    # Verify notification sent
    notification_spy.assert_called_once()
    assert notification_spy.call_args[0][0] == "user_123"  # Recipient
    assert "assigned" in notification_spy.call_args[0][1]  # Message
```

2. Task creation, assignment, and status progression
3. Project creation and team collaboration
4. Notification delivery and response
5. Report generation and export
6. File attachment upload and download
7. Real-time collaboration features

**UI Automation Approach:**

- Page Object Model pattern for UI elements
- Custom commands for repetitive actions
- Visual regression testing for UI components
- Accessibility testing integration

**Performance Testing Requirements:**

| Test Type | Scenarios | Success Criteria |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| Load Testing | 500 concurrent users performing typical actions | Response time < 1s for 95% of requests |
| Stress Testing | Gradually increasing to 2000 concurrent users | System remains stable and recovers after load reduction |
| Endurance Testing | 300 concurrent users for 24 hours | No memory leaks, response time degradation < 20% |

**Cross-browser Testing Strategy:**

- Automated testing on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Mobile responsive testing on iOS and Android browsers
- Accessibility testing across browsers
- Visual consistency checking

- HTML reports with failure screenshots for E2E tests
- Test execution trends over time
- Coverage reports with highlighting of untested code
- Slack/email notifications for test failures

**Failed Test Handling:**

1. Automatic retry of failed E2E tests (max 2 retries)
2. Detailed failure logs with context information
3. Screenshot and video capture for UI test failures
4. Failure categorization (test issue vs. system issue)
5. GitHub issues created automatically for consistent failures

**Flaky Test Management:**

- Quarantine mechanism for isolating flaky tests
- Tracking of flakiness percentage over time
- Automatic flagging of tests with >5% failure rate
- Weekly review of flaky tests for remediation

| Compute Optimization | Right-sizing and auto-scaling policies | 20-25% vs. static provisioning |
| Spot Instances | Use for non-critical workloads and batch processing | 60-70% for eligible workloads |
| Storage Tiering | S3 lifecycle policies for aging attachments | 40-50% for eligible data |
| Free Tier Utilization | Leverage AWS Free Tier for development and testing | Varies |
| Cost Monitoring | AWS Cost Explorer with budgets and alerts | Proactive cost management |

**Estimated Monthly Infrastructure Cost**

| Environment | Component | Monthly Estimate (USD) |
|-------------|-----------|------------------------|
| Development | Compute, Storage, Network | $1,200 - $1,800 |
| Staging | Compute, Storage, Network | $1,800 - $2,400 |
| Production | Compute, Storage, Network | $5,000 - $7,000 |
| DR | Compute, Storage, Network | $2,000 - $3,000 |
| Total | All Environments | $10,000 - $14,200 |

*Note: Actual costs will vary based on usage patterns, data transfer, and optimization efforts.*

#### 8.2.5 Security and Compliance Considerations

| Security Aspect | Implementation | Compliance Standards |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Network Security | VPC isolation, security groups, NACLs | SOC 2, GDPR |
| Data Security | Encryption at rest (KMS), in transit (TLS 1.2+) | SOC 2, GDPR, CCPA |
| Access Control | IAM roles with least privilege, MFA | SOC 2 |
| Audit Logging | CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs | SOC 2, GDPR |
| Vulnerability Management | GuardDuty, Inspector, automated patching | SOC 2 |
| Compliance Monitoring | AWS Config, Security Hub | SOC 2, GDPR, CCPA |

### 8.3 CONTAINERIZATION

#### 8.3.1 Container Platform Selection

| Platform | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| Docker | Industry standard, extensive tooling | Requires orchestration | Selected as standard container runtime |
| Podman | Daemonless, rootless containers | Less mature ecosystem | Not selected due to AWS ECS compatibility |
| Containerd | Lightweight, OCI compliant | Lower-level than Docker | Not selected for developer experience |

Docker is selected as the containerization platform for compatibility with AWS ECS and developer familiarity.

#### 8.3.2 Base Image Strategy

| Component | Base Image | Justification |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Backend Services | python:3.11-slim | Minimized image size while providing required dependencies |
| Frontend | node:18-alpine | Lightweight, secure base for frontend assets |
| Worker Services | python:3.11-slim | Consistent with backend services |
| Infrastructure Tools | alpine:3.16 | Minimal footprint for utility containers |

**Base Image Guidelines:**
- Use specific version tags (avoid `latest`)
- Prefer official images from verified publishers
- Use slim/alpine variants where possible
- Scan images for vulnerabilities before use
- Rebuild monthly to incorporate security patches

#### 8.3.3 Image Versioning Approach

| Version Component | Format | Example | Usage |
|-------------------|--------|---------|-------|
| Application Version | Semantic version | v1.2.3 | Major functional releases |
| Build Identifier | Short git hash | abc123f | Unique build identifier |
| Environment Indicator | Environment prefix | prod-, stage-, dev- | Environment targeting |
| Full Image Tag | app:version-hash-env | taskservice:v1.2.3-abc123f-prod | Complete image identifier |

**Container Registry Strategy:**
- AWS ECR private repositories for all container images
- Immutable tags enforced
- Image scanning on push
- Lifecycle policies to remove unused images after 90 days

#### 8.3.4 Build Optimization Techniques

| Technique | Implementation | Benefit |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Multi-stage Builds | Separate build and runtime stages | Smaller final images, segregated build dependencies |
| Layer Caching | Order Dockerfile commands by change frequency | Faster builds, reduced bandwidth |
| Dependency Caching | Use BuildKit cache mounts for package managers | Faster builds, reduced external dependencies |
| Image Scanning | Scan during build and before deployment | Early vulnerability detection |
| Parallelization | Build independent images in parallel | Faster total build time |

**Example Optimized Backend Dockerfile:**

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM python:3.11-slim AS builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --user -r requirements.txt

# Runtime stage
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Copy only the installed packages from builder
COPY --from=builder /root/.local /root/.local
ENV PATH=/root/.local/bin:$PATH

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Default configuration (overridden by environment)
ENV MODULE_NAME="app.main"
ENV VARIABLE_NAME="app"
ENV PORT=8000

EXPOSE $PORT

# Non-root user for security
RUN adduser --disabled-password --gecos "" appuser
USER appuser

CMD uvicorn $MODULE_NAME:$VARIABLE_NAME --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

#### 8.3.5 Security Scanning Requirements

| Scan Type | Tool | Frequency | Integration Point |
|-----------|------|-----------|------------------|
| Image Vulnerability | Trivy | Every build | CI pipeline |
| Dependency Scan | OWASP Dependency Check | Every build | CI pipeline |
| Secret Detection | git-secrets | Pre-commit, CI pipeline | Developer workflow, CI |
| Configuration Audit | KubeSec | Pre-deployment | CI/CD pipeline |
| Runtime Security | Falco | Continuous | Kubernetes/ECS |

**Security Policy Requirements:**
- Zero critical vulnerabilities allowed in production images
- Image signing required for production deployments
- Automated patching for base images
- Regular security assessments of container configurations

### 8.4 ORCHESTRATION

#### 8.4.1 Orchestration Platform Selection

| Platform | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| AWS ECS on Fargate | Serverless, AWS-integrated, simpler management | AWS-specific, less feature-rich than Kubernetes | Selected for AWS integration and operational simplicity |
| Kubernetes (EKS) | Feature-rich, portable, extensive ecosystem | Higher operational complexity, steeper learning curve | Alternative for future if more flexibility needed |
| Docker Swarm | Simplicity, Docker integration | Limited features, less industry adoption | Not selected due to limitation in advanced orchestration |

AWS ECS with Fargate is selected as the orchestration platform for its seamless AWS integration, reduced operational overhead, and sufficient feature set for our microservices architecture.

|---------|--------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Authentication | CPU Utilization | 70% for 3 minutes | 30% for 10 minutes | 4 | 12 |
| Task Service | Request Count | >100 req/target/minute | <30 req/target/minute | 6 | 20 |
| Project Service | CPU Utilization | 65% for 3 minutes | 30% for 10 minutes | 4 | 12 |
| Notification | Queue Depth | >1000 messages | <100 messages | 3 | 10 |
| File Service | CPU Utilization | 60% for 3 minutes | 30% for 10 minutes | 4 | 12 |

**Predictive Scaling:**
- Schedule-based scaling for known peak periods
- Historical usage pattern analysis
- Automatic adjustment of scaling parameters based on actual load

#### 8.4.5 Resource Allocation Policies

| Service | CPU Allocation | Memory Allocation | Justification |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Authentication | 1 vCPU | 2 GB | CPU intensive for cryptography operations |
| Task Service | 2 vCPU | 4 GB | Higher throughput for core business logic |
| Project Service | 1 vCPU | 2 GB | Moderate resource requirements |
| Notification | 0.5 vCPU | 1 GB | Lightweight, event-driven workload |
| File Service | 2 vCPU | 4 GB | I/O and CPU intensive for file operations |
| Analytics | 2 vCPU | 8 GB | Memory intensive for aggregation operations |

**Resource Optimization Strategies:**
- Regular right-sizing based on CloudWatch metrics
- Use of Fargate Spot for cost-effective non-critical workloads
- CPU bursting configured for appropriate tasks
- Memory overcommit protection via hard limits
