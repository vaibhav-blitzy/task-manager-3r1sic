## Authentication & Authorization

The system uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization.

### Authentication Flow

1. User submits credentials (email/password)
2. Server validates credentials and generates JWT tokens (access and refresh)
3. Access token is short-lived (15 minutes) and used for API requests
4. Refresh token is longer-lived (7 days) and used to obtain new access tokens
5. Tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies or local storage (configurable)

### Authorization Model

The system uses a role-based access control (RBAC) model with the following components:

- **Roles**: Predefined sets of permissions (Admin, Manager, User)
- **Permissions**: Fine-grained access controls for specific actions
- **Resources**: Objects that can be accessed (tasks, projects, etc.)

Authorization is enforced at multiple levels:
1. API Gateway: Basic authentication and route protection
2. Service Layer: Role and permission verification
3. Data Access Layer: Object-level access control

## Task Management

The task management functionality is implemented in the Task service.

### Task States

Tasks can be in the following states:
- `created`: Initial state when a task is created
- `assigned`: Task has been assigned to a user
- `in_progress`: Work has started on the task
- `on_hold`: Task is temporarily paused
- `in_review`: Task is completed and awaiting review
- `completed`: Task is fully completed
- `cancelled`: Task has been cancelled

State transitions are controlled by the `set_status` method in the Task model, which enforces valid transitions.

### Task Relationships

Tasks can have the following relationships:
- **Subtasks**: Hierarchical parent-child relationships
- **Dependencies**: Tasks that block or are blocked by other tasks
- **Project Membership**: Tasks belong to projects

### Task Lifecycle

1. Task is created with initial properties
2. Task is assigned to a user (changes status to `assigned`)
3. User starts work (changes status to `in_progress`)
4. Task may be put on hold or submitted for review
5. Task is completed or cancelled (terminal states)

## Project Management

The project management functionality is implemented in the Project service.

### Project Structure

Projects provide organization for tasks and team collaboration:
- Projects have members with specific roles
- Projects can contain multiple task lists
- Projects have their own settings and metadata

### Project Roles

Project members can have the following roles:
- **Admin**: Full control over the project
- **Manager**: Can manage tasks but not project settings
- **Member**: Can create and update tasks
- **Viewer**: Read-only access

### Project Lifecycle

1. Project is created with initial properties
2. Members are added with specific roles
3. Tasks are created and organized within the project
4. Project progresses through its lifecycle (planning, active, completed, archived)

## File Management

The file management functionality is implemented in the File service.

### File Upload Process

1. Client requests an upload URL from the File service
2. File service generates a pre-signed URL for direct upload
3. Client uploads the file directly to storage
4. File service creates metadata and associates the file with tasks/projects

### File Security

Files are secured through multiple mechanisms:
- Access control based on task/project permissions
- Virus scanning before storage
- Encryption at rest
- Short-lived access URLs

## Notification System

The notification system is implemented in the Notification service.

### Notification Channels

Notifications can be delivered through multiple channels:
- **In-app**: Real-time notifications within the application
- **Email**: Email notifications for important events
- **Push**: Mobile push notifications (if enabled)

### Notification Types

The system supports various notification types:
- Task assignments
- Status changes
- Comments
- Mentions
- Due date reminders
- Project invitations

### Notification Preferences

Users can configure their notification preferences:
- Enable/disable specific notification types
- Choose delivery channels for each type
- Set quiet hours for notifications

## Real-time Collaboration

Real-time collaboration is implemented using WebSockets through the Real-time service.

### WebSocket Communication

The WebSocket connection enables:
- Real-time updates when tasks or projects change
- Presence awareness (who is online)
- Collaborative editing with conflict resolution
- Typing indicators

### Event Types

The real-time system handles various event types:
- Task updates
- Status changes

| Task Service | Core task management | Task CRUD, status management, assignment |
| Project Service | Project organization | Project CRUD, team management, categorization |
| Notification Service | Alert delivery | Notification preferences, multi-channel delivery |
| File Service | File management | File uploads, storage, versioning |
| Analytics Service | Reporting and metrics | Dashboard data, report generation |
| Real-time Service | Live collaboration | WebSocket connections, presence tracking |
| API Gateway | Request routing | Authentication, rate limiting, request routing |

## 3. Development Workflow

### 3.1 Branching Strategy

We follow a trunk-based development approach with the following branches:

| Branch Type | Naming Convention | Purpose | Base Branch |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|------------|
| Main | `main` | Production-ready code | - |
| Development | `develop` | Integration branch | `main` |
| Feature | `feature/<feature-name>` | New features | `develop` |
| Bug fix | `bugfix/<bug-name>` | Bug fixes | `develop` |
| Hotfix | `hotfix/<fix-name>` | Urgent production fixes | `main` |

### 3.2 Commit Message Format

We follow the conventional commits format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types include**:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code functionality
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `test`: Adding or fixing tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples**:
```
feat(auth): implement multi-factor authentication
fix(tasks): correct validation error in task creation
docs(api): update authentication endpoint documentation
```

### 3.3 Development Process

1. **Select an issue** from the issue tracker
2. **Create a branch** following our naming convention
3. **Implement your changes** following our coding standards
4. **Write tests** to cover your changes
5. **Update documentation** as needed
6. **Submit a pull request** following our PR template
7. **Address review feedback** and make necessary changes
8. **Merge** once approved and all checks pass

### 3.4 Starting the Development Environment

1. Start the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
