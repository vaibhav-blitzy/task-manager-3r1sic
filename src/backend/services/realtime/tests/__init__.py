This file makes the 'tests' directory a proper Python package,
enabling pytest to discover and collect tests correctly.

The test package follows the standard pytest structure with:
- unit/: Contains unit tests for individual components
- integration/: Contains integration tests between components
- conftest.py: Defines test fixtures and configuration
