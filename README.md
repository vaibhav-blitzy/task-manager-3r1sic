- **Search Functionality**: Efficient search for tasks, projects, and content using keywords and filters.

## Architecture Overview

The Task Management System follows a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, resilience, and maintainability. Key components include:

- **API Gateway**: Handles request routing, authentication, and rate limiting.
- **Authentication Service**: Manages user identity, access control, and session management.
- **Task Management Service**: Handles task creation, updates, and state transitions.

- **Notification Service**: Delivers real-time and email notifications.
- **File Management Service**: Manages file storage and attachments.
- **Analytics Service**: Provides reporting and analytics capabilities.
- **Real-time Collaboration Service**: Enables real-time updates and collaboration.

## Technology Stack

The system is built using the following technologies:

- **Backend**: Python 3.11 with Flask framework
- **Frontend**: TypeScript 5.2 with React framework
- **Database**: MongoDB for primary data storage
- **Cache**: Redis for caching and real-time data management
- **Containerization**: Docker for application packaging
- **Orchestration**: AWS ECS for container orchestration

## Installation Instructions

To set up the Task Management System, follow these steps:
